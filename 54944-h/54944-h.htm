  <h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>The <i>Journal</i> of Bourgoyne, which I had meant
originally to be the text of this volume, is a work
of some importance in helping us to elucidate the
life and later days of the Queen of Scots. I have
considered it necessary, for the benefit of the
reader, to reproduce also a Summary of the
voluminous correspondence which took place
during the same period between Queen Mary
and her confrères, and Elizabeth, and the leading
ministers and secretaries of the Crown of
England. The correspondence discloses the
political manœuvres and secret negotiations of
that eventful time—the last six months of Queen
Mary's life: and the Summary occupies the first
half of the volume. It has been impossible to
restrict it further and convey to the reader what
is meant to be conveyed—an intelligible estimate
of her prison life, with all its painful vicissitudes.
The letters have an important bearing on the
character of the Scottish Queen, and illustrate
the situation better than can be done by any
criticism.</p>

<p>The fascination of Mary Stuart as the central
figure of the greatest drama in Scottish history is
an additional reason for putting another volume
before the public, even though the literature on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
subject is abundant; while Bourgoyne's <i>Journal</i>,
now specially translated, we must remember, has
not been much in evidence in its original form.
It is really a domestic, not a political or daily,
record, and is the only such record we possess,
for no historian has attempted to give more than
an outline of her public career. In this <i>Journal</i>
there are entries of which we have hitherto been
unaware; entries which manifest the cunning and
deception of that age; chiefly and more particularly
the administration of the Crown of England—thrilling
reading—Elizabeth occupying the foreground
and swaying the sceptre in a manner that
must be read to be appreciated.</p>

<p>A large portion of the matter in this volume is
published now for the first time, and to the rising
generation the entire narrative will be quite new.
The greatest point of historical importance resulting
from a study of this <i>Journal</i> is its determination,
and settlement of all doubt, of the innocence
of Queen Mary of having had any connection with
any plot against the life of Elizabeth; or with that
huge fraud the Babington Conspiracy. How this
is established the reader will realise from the
accompanying recital.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span>
may be said without qualification that no one
who has not read the <i>Journal</i> of Bourgoyne can
have an adequate conception of the life of the
Queen of Scots during her last days. These have
been very little touched upon by many of the writers
whose works we possess, and the reason is obvious.
The life of the Queen engrossed the attention
of historians, and was in itself so eventful as to
practically overshadow the later days of her career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>That momentous time forms the subject of this
volume, and for those who are interested in the
history of that period this narrative is more
particularly intended. Bourgoyne's notes extend
from August 1586 to February 1587, and his
summary may be regarded as the best and
most accurate we possess of Queen Mary's life
during what may very properly be called “The
Reign of Terror.”</p>

<p>Mary was overwhelmed with humiliation and
misery from her long confinement and the failure
of all her plans to effect her escape, while her
mind was constantly on the rack in order to
protect herself from the espionage of spies, and
the systematic intercepting of her letters, resulting
in their decipherment and forgery. The correspondence
of the time is voluminous, much of
it bearing on the so-called Babington Conspiracy
and the determined efforts of Elizabeth and Walsingham
to involve Mary in that plot; Mary's
release, and the plots originated to effect that
release; and the mass of correspondence which
these plots involved.</p>

<p>It would be an insufficient presentation of the
case to say that Queen Mary's misery arose from
her unwarrantable treatment. The treatment
meted out to her by the express command of
Elizabeth was, during the whole nineteen years
of her captivity, one of studied and detestable
cruelty, but for the period under review it was
greatly accentuated. It was cruel, harsh, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
inhuman, destitute of every element of justice and
mercy, reminding us more of the barbarism of uncivilised
rule in the dark ages,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">“When wild in woods</div>
    <div class="verse">The noble Savage ran,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">than of a court at the close of the sixteenth century
with Queen Elizabeth and Lord Burghley at its
head. It was a systematic course of torture, kept
up daily and terminating with the disgraceful
scene at the execution, when the feeble, and pitiable,
and defenceless condition of the Queen might
have aroused the compassion of her enemies, and
spared her the outrage of Fletcher, the Dean of
the Diocese, but it did not.</p>

<p>It is due to the Catholic party to say that every
movement of Elizabeth was jealously and indignantly
watched by them, while Mary's long captivity,
coupled with the active reign of her son,
seems to have materially toned down the enthusiasm
so long felt for her in Scotland. From the
businesslike way in which the official papers are
now kalendered, we are able to give the text
of documents which fifty years ago were not
available, and to form a more accurate and intelligible
estimate of the whole situation, around
which so much controversy has arisen. To many
readers these papers will be quite new. They
are important as unfolding the intrigues of that
turbulent age; the true, unvarnished character of
the Queen of England, showing that her primary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
object was the destruction of the Queen of Scots,
her part of the drama being to indicate the means
by which that was to be brought about. Her disregard
of truth, her duplicity, her indifference to
cruelty and murder, and her strong resemblance
in that respect to her father, Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>,
constituted her a notable member of the house of
Tudor. Her treatment of the Queen of Scots is
probably without a parallel in history; and it is a
curious fact that during Mary's captivity neither
her ministers nor her nobility, notwithstanding her
unlawful conduct, could induce her to release, or
modify the treatment of, the Scottish Queen.
They experienced under her a “Reign of Terror,”
but of a different kind from that of the unfortunate
Mary.</p>

<p>Nor is any adequate reason given by her, certainly
no <i>bonâ fide</i> reason, unless it were that Mary
was the nearest heir to the Crown of England, and
greatly her superior in every human accomplishment.
A conspicuous element in this matter is the
servility of her ministers. Burghley and Walsingham
led the way as her lieutenants, while that poor
creature, Sir Amias Paulet, was always ready and
willing to torture the Queen of Scots and fall down
and worship Elizabeth so long as he was paid to
do so. These men were properly educated in the
peculiar tactics and sentiments of their mistress.
They knew her mind regarding Mary. They
foresaw the end: that the latter was to be
condemned, and that that was to be done, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
afterwards appeared, by tampering with Mary's
letters. Elizabeth's policy was absolute, disobedience
to her commands being punishable
with death.</p>

<p>Of the ability of Burghley there can be but one
opinion, and it is extraordinary that he compromised
himself with a scheme for the destruction
of a defenceless and innocent woman for no other
reason than to please Elizabeth. His attitude to
Mary cannot be defended. Bourgoyne refers to
him as a very vehement (very violent) man. That
Burghley's private opinion was contrary to the
attitude he was compelled to take up may, we think,
be suggested. His conduct towards Mary was
intelligible only as a stern command from his
Sovereign. With Walsingham the case is different.
He was a man evidently cast in a similar
mould to that of his mistress, unscrupulous, unprincipled;
and of all the villainy in connection
with the Babington Conspiracy he may be said to
have been the author: for in addition to intercepting
and interpolating Queen Mary's letters by
means of spies, and producing the material which
accomplished her destruction, he executed in cold
blood Anthony Babington and his eleven companions
after a mock trial, or no trial at all, victims
of a plot of his own creation, and because they
were the only human beings who could prove
Mary's innocence of this base and contemptible
enterprise.</p>

<p>Walsingham's character is thus given by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
eminent writer:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He was ambitious, cunning,
heartless, and a liar. He also ruined more innocent
persons than the whole of Elizabeth's Privy
Council. It was he who overwhelmed the Earls
of Arundel and Northumberland, destroyed the
Howard family, covered the sea and the
Continent with English exiles, and spread over
Europe a leprous spying; while he encouraged,
led on, and ruined Babington. And another
writer<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> says of him:
He completely deceived
Charles <span class="smcap">IX.</span> and the house of Austria, fomented
the insurrection of the Huguenots in France and
the wars of the Low Countries at the time that
he was trusted by both reigning houses. It is
said that he employed in foreign courts fifty-three
secret agents and eighteen spies, and that he had
the wonderful art of weaving plots in which many
people got so entangled that they could not escape.
He obtained evidence of the setting out of the
Armada by a copy of a letter written by Philip
King of Spain to the Pope, procured him by a
priestly spy, who bribed a gentleman of the Pope's
bedchamber to steal the key of his Holiness'
cabinet, and while the Pope slept to transcribe
the letter and return the key. This summary of
Walsingham's character fully corroborates his conduct
to the Scottish Queen.</p>

<p>Though free from dread of Scotland, Walsingham
conceived and carried out the most treacherous
and shameful plot recorded in history. He himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
led the Catholics to conspire against Elizabeth.
He managed to implicate the Queen of Scots, that
he might be able to massacre with seeming justice
the royal prisoner and her defenders. His spies
filled the ports, towns, and even seminaries. He
made use of Catholic conspirators to accuse and
ruin Mary. His task was easy; for it was quite
natural that a Queen held against all right a
captive for many long years should give way to
hope and encourage those who might try to release
her.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
There is reason to believe that the plots for
Queen Mary's release during the nineteen years
of her captivity were pretty numerous, as the
activity of the Queen and the Catholics of England,
France, and Spain was unabated. These plots
are practically unrecorded, the inference being
that they all broke down from one reason or
another before arriving at maturity. There were
also plots by Elizabeth to take the life of the
Queen of Scots privately, such as the one to have
her drowned and the other to have her poisoned
or executed in private, but these also fell through.
The last plot for Mary's liberation had the
elements of success had it been managed with
greater skill and judgment. All the arrangements
were as good as completed when it was discovered
by Walsingham. It has been the subject of much
controversy arising from the extraordinary nature
of its negotiation and development. When every
plot for Mary's release had failed, and her friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
were wearied out with her long captivity, an
English Catholic named John Savage, who had
served under the Prince of Parma in the Spanish
army, had a conference on the subject of Mary's
release with some of the priests at Rheims. At
this conference Savage undertook the assassination
of Elizabeth with his own hands. About the same
time another plot was formed by Ballard, who had
a conference with Charles Paget, Morgan, and
Mendoza regarding an invasion of England and
the deliverance of Mary. He arrived in London
on 22nd May, when he met Babington. Babington
had been a page on the staff of Lord Shrewsbury
at Sheffield, but he was also connected with a
good family in Derbyshire. Ballard, it is alleged,
informed him of the proposed assassination, and
that it would precede the invasion of England.
Babington would not entertain the assassination,
but he entered into a plot for the liberation of
Mary—the Babington Plot.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These three men—Savage,
Ballard, and Babington—were all
executed for this plot. In Chapter XII. of this
volume (appendix) we have reproduced some remarkable
letters in connection with these plots
for the Scottish Queen's release which throw
additional light on the subject.</p>

<p>Before reproducing Bourgoyne's <i>Journal</i> it will
be necessary for the reader's benefit to give a
summary of the correspondence and political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
manœuvres of the period. The accompanying
narrative will enable the reader to recognise Queen
Mary's actual position and circumstances, and the
unconquerable spirit she manifested to the very
last in defending herself for nineteen years against
the false and calumnious charges of her enemies.
The people of Scotland appear to have been quite
in the dark, and to have taken no part in the
extraordinary proceedings that in her last days
were going on.</p>

<p>One writer informs us that her death was not
known in Scotland for a month after its occurrence,
while the administration of the Crown of
England for this period was almost wholly confined
to her persecution and the creating of
schemes by which her death might be accomplished.</p>

<p>When Mary abandoned all hope of getting
satisfaction from Elizabeth, she addressed a
communication on the subject to Chateauneuf, the
French Ambassador in London, setting forth the
nature of her grievances, and desired him to
discuss the same with Elizabeth. This letter
leaves us in no doubt regarding the sufferings of
the writer. She speaks plainly of the cruelty of
Elizabeth and of the “infirm and pitiable condition
to which eighteen years of imprisonment
have brought me”; that for four years she had
endeavoured to please Elizabeth, and had sent
her secretary with <i>carte blanche</i> to come to terms
with her; but everything had failed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Ambassador discussed it very seriously with Elizabeth,
but made no impression. A few days after
the despatch of this letter Mary wrote another to
Chateauneuf, both of which we reproduce slightly
condensed.</p>

<p>The letter to the French Ambassador speaks
for itself, and gives us a better idea of her forlorn
condition than any other paper we possess. It is
painfully evident that she was reduced to the level
of a criminal, and every comfort and every means
of recreation denied her. Nobody was permitted
even to approach the house where she was living
without declaring their object, and no one was
allowed to have access to her. “It is unreasonable,”
as she says, “to make me suffer for that
of which I am not the cause.” But that is not
the most painful part of this pitiable letter. She
adds, “And to speak still more freely, necessity
making me, to my great regret, overcome shame,
I began to be very ill attended to in my own
person, and with no regard to my infirm state.”
Even if Mary had been guilty of all that was laid
to her charge, this treatment by the English Queen
was infamous, and what is to be said if she was
innocent? It was only a month after the date of
this letter that the kidnapping of Mary took place
by Elizabeth's command. The letter was in the
following terms:—</p>

<p>Queen Mary to Chateauneuf, end of July
1586, Chartley:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>“In consequence of the small satisfaction which
I receive in all that concerns my condition here, I
am constrained once for all to represent by you to
the Queen of England my very strong complaints
in this respect, seeing that the more passively I
have endured all this time to give proof to her
of the determination which I had in complying
in all and by all with her, so much the more they
reduce me step by step to the utmost distress,
without any regard to my rank and without
consideration of the infirm and pitiful condition
to which eighteen years of imprisonment have
brought me, or recollection of the promises which
the said Queen has made to me to the contrary.
So that it appears that my enemies, who in expectation
of my death being at hand, in my
sickness had last summer slightly relaxed their
rage against me, wish to retrace their former
steps to hasten by evil and unworthy treatment
that which they do not wish or are unable to
execute otherwise, lest they make themselves
openly culpable.</p>

<p>“I have constantly during the space of four
years courted the Queen of England by the most
advantageous overtures and endeavours and correspondence
to come to the point of some good
agreement with her, and at last I sent to her my
secretary in a manner with <i>carte blanche</i>.</p>

<p>“I made such offers to her that herself and
those of her Council wrote to me they could desire
nothing more on my part; and in sooth there never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
was seen nor heard of a Sovereign prince imprisoned,
rightfully or wrongfully, who has redeemed
his liberty on conditions so unreasonable for himself.
Not only has there been nothing further
done with regard to my propositions for my
liberation as I had been assured of it, but almost
nothing of that which had been promised has been
performed to me. Instead of the mission of
certain of my servants to my son, which had been
granted to me in order to make an end with him
of the hindrance which they alleged he made to
my treaty of liberation, and which they said
prevented the Queen from going further into it, I
have been shut up entirely out of the way and
separated from him, in order the better to reunite
him to our common enemies here and to expose
or subject him to his rebellious subjects. For my
safety in this bondage there is nobody of judgment
who does not consider it less at present than in
the hands of one of the peers and lords of this
kingdom, of reputation, force, and power sufficient
to preserve me against the attempts of my enemies
whatever may happen; which has always been
my principal desire since they have removed me
from the custody of Lord Shrewsbury; and in that
I do not mean to do wrong to my present keeper,
whom in other respects I consider a very honourable
gentleman and faithful servant of his
mistress.</p>

<p>“With regard to my condition and treatment
here, which the said Queen had expressly written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to me she wished to do all things very honourably
as far as to disclaim that of the past, I must
say in a word that I find myself at the present
time rather confined in a gaol than in a prince's
captivity, much below me or whom they could
by right of war or otherwise justly detain. I am
interdicted from all private correspondence with
my son, to whose welfare and preservation as I
feel myself obliged to have regard, so much the
more I have of sorrow and torture in being unable
to render him this maternal duty in the straits and
necessity wherein he very often is.</p>

<p>“As to my private affairs, you are aware of the
severity exercised at Chartley when he came to
give an account of them, so that his journey to me
amounted almost to nothing.</p>

<p>“My servants' despatches are delivered to me
with so much delay, and mine to them, that the
opportunities usually slip away before I can make
use of them, the necessity, nevertheless, for it being
such, that I am put as they say to my last shift.
The place in which I am is made so detestable by
the severity which is exercised to all who approach
to it even for the ordinary conveniences necessary
for me and my servants, and I am seldom permitted
to do good to any poor person in the
neighbourhood, the distribution of my alms having
been removed from me this year, that it was too
apparent how much they endeavour to make me
be reputed and held as some savage and complete
stranger, and so insult those not only who should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
have some respect for me, but whoever will have
anything to do with me and my servants.</p>

<p>“I have not until now had so much need of
having a fixed residence in which I might settle
myself with the conveniences requisite for my
health, being but as one passing from inn to inn.</p>

<p>“In like manner the expenditure of my household
remains, from what I hear, so uncertain that
I cannot in any way check it, being always
dependent on the goodwill of the person who
shall have charge of me for retrenching and
disposing of it as he shall think fit. The freedom
promised for my exercise with some recreation
has not been preserved to me, being now prohibited
from going out on festival days, without
considering that in consequence of my ailments,
and that the time does not always suit, especially
winter, I must take it when I can. Other
encroachments have been made which I cannot
construe, but the restriction and deterioration of
my former state, instead of having it amended
as they promised me: it serving no purpose to
say that the time has not been suitable for it,
owing to the disorders which have happened in
Christendom, as they have always replied to me,
except that they wish more plainly to say that
they cannot find the time suitable for doing me a
good act. It is unreasonable to make me suffer
for that of which I am not the cause, and perchance
the treaty between the said Queen and
me had by it prevented a part. I had hoped that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the evidence of my sincerity destroying in her
impressions to the contrary would revive towards
me her good disposition, and procure for me the
satisfaction of passing the little of life that remains
to me in the close friendship which I have always
so much desired with her. But alas! I fear that
the evil has gone so far as to be irremediable,
however I may endeavour to place the good
against the evil, my enemies being unable to
content themselves with this my long-suffering
and imprisonment, or that in it I may never
have any peace of mind or body. And to speak
still more freely to you, necessity making me
thereon, to my great regret, overcome shame.
I begin to be very ill attended to in my own
person, and with no regard to my infirm state,
which deprives me in a manner mostly of all
appetite. For which if they had been inclined
to allow me to supply it at my own cost I should
not have made entreaty. Being more than ever
entirely hopeless of better treatment and of
securing my condition and rest here for the
future, I have resolved to renew more urgently
than ever the request I have made to the said
Queen all these years past for my liberation,
conjuring her in God's name, and in as far as
her conscience towards herself and honour before
the world are dear to her, to see to it speedily.
I entreat you very earnestly to interpose thereto
as far as you can the weight and intercession of
the King your master, my brother-in-law, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
mediator always proposed by me in that matter.
The physicians are of opinion that there are no
means left for preserving my life by strengthening
my nerves from the weakness of which by want
of exercise all my maladies proceed, but by some
natural warm baths of Italy, which, being impossible
to be had in this country, it seems to
me that the said Queen, in the imminent danger
in which she knows I am, ought to feel responsible
for the evil consequences which may arise from
refusing this last and only remedy.</p>

<p>The second letter was as follows:—</p>

<p>Queen Mary to Chateauneuf, 13th July 1586,
Chartley:</p>
<p>“I do not know what determination has been
taken for my change of residence and the passports
of my servants; but my keeper for some
days has shown himself much more vigorous and
overbearing than ordinary, cutting off entirely
all access round about this house from everyone
whosoever, and intending to reduce the expenditure
of my household as strictly as he can,
contrary to the order settled and decided by the
Queen of England and her Council. If this
restriction continues it will be the means of
making my servants more weary of this prison
and altogether insupportable to them. I have
heard a report, but uncertain, that my keeper is
to be discharged at the end of this summer, and
some suppose I am to be delivered to the Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Shrewsbury, which I can with very great difficulty
bring myself to believe. He speaks also of
removing from me all the English servants which
I have in my household. But I dare not take
notice of anything until my keeper gives me a
hint of it. In truth I shall not be sorry to
change my host, for he is one of the most
whimsical and austere persons whom I have ever
known, and in a word fitter for a gaol of criminals
than for the custody of one of my rank and birth.
Besides that, in the event of the death of the
Queen of England, I should think my life very
insecure in his hands, from his little rank, credit,
influence, and power, and especially in this quarter,
where he makes himself exceedingly hated and
ill-liked. There would be no harm in your
speaking of it to Lord Burghley, but it should
only be by way of conversation and from yourself
on the authority of some of my friends in
this kingdom, without giving him any ground
of suspicion that the wind blows from this
quarter.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<hr class="small" />

<p>When Bourgoyne began this <i>Journal</i> the Queen
would be fully eighteen years in captivity. It
will be noticed that Paulet her gaoler appears
to have had <i>carte blanche</i> from Elizabeth to
treat her with every mark of cruelty. Every
such act was communicated to her, and that she
never disapproved of what Paulet did indicated
her tacit consent to what was going on. Considering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Mary's long captivity, and the weakness
of her physical frame as the result of that captivity,
it is almost impossible to conceive that Elizabeth
or her ministers could authorise such treatment
as is fully set out in these letters. It would
appear from this <i>Journal</i> and from other documentary
evidence that Mary's life was doomed
before any trial ever took place at Fotheringay.
Paulet's execution of Elizabeth's orders, no doubt
well discussed at the Privy Council, was to lead
up as it did to Mary's execution. Her first act
towards that end as recorded by Bourgoyne was
the bogus Stag Hunt at Chartley—the kidnapping
incident. What could be more disgraceful than
that proceeding?</p>

<p>It is briefly referred to by some historians as
merely the removal of the Queen to Tixall, but
Bourgoyne's <i>Journal</i> discloses the true nature of
the transaction; and the full description given by
him, which may be accepted as authentic, shows
that this outrage was an act of kidnapping pure
and simple. On 3rd August there was a conference
to arrange the details, between Paulet and
Wade, the latter one of Elizabeth's secretaries.
The narrative of this private conference, which
evidently was not intended to be made public,
affords us a side-light into the machinations of
the period, and identifies Elizabeth with this
crafty and cunning plot. The composition of the
narrative is evidently hers, and the plot was carried
out to the letter. (See Bourgoyne, pp. 160-70.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
At this conference Elizabeth's questions were put
down accompanied by Paulet's answers.</p>

<p>The reader will notice that the principal event
is left to the last; that the seizure of Mary's papers
and the seizing of Nau and Curle are plausibly
put in the foreground. It is of great importance
that these papers are preserved. This document
was sent to Walsingham accompanied by the
following letter from Paulet:—</p>

<p>“Chartley, 3rd August 1586. I heard from Mr.
Wade yesterday, and this morning I met him and
conferred with him at length, as will appear by
these notes enclosed. He procured the substitute,
and was the only messenger between him and me.
He had been charged and troubled many ways, as
knoweth the Almighty, who always preserve you.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Memoranda of a conference between Paulet
and Wade about the manner of seizing Queen
Mary's papers and the kidnapping of the Queen
of Scots:—</p>

<p>“That Her Majesty (Elizabeth) desires Sir
Amias Paulet to consider in what manner the
Queen (his charge's) writings might be best
seized on, whether remaining there, or removing
her to some other place under the colour of
hunting or taking the air would be best. This
Queen will be easily induced to kill a stag in Sir
Walter Aston's park, where order being taken
with her, some gentleman of credit may be sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
forthwith to seize her chambers and cabinets in
this house, and to remove out of it the gentlewomen
they shall find there.</p>

<p>“That he also consider how Nau and Curle
may be best apprehended, and in what manner
that seemeth meet that they be apprehended at
the very instant of the challenge made to the
Queen.”</p>

<p><i>Reply</i>: “I would not advise that this enterprise
should be unfurnished with gentlemen of
trust and credit, but that two gentlemen be sent
to take the charge of the conducting of Nau and
Curle, so as to keep them from conference.
Pasquier is half a secretary and much employed
in writing, and perchance not unacquainted with
great causes.”</p>

<p>“Consider whether it be not fit to remove her,
and to what place. What persons are to be
retained about her, and in what manner she shall
be kept.”</p>

<p><i>Reply</i>: “The cabinets and other places cannot
be duly searched unless she be removed, because
the doing thereof will require some leisure, and
she cannot be lodged in any other place in this
house than where the cabinets are. Three gentlewomen,
her master cook, her panterer, and two
grooms of her chamber, may suffice in the beginning
of this removal but may be increased afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Decide in what manner she should be removed
and under what guard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Reply</i>: “Sir Walter Aston's house seems for
many reasons the fittest for this purpose, and he
may convey her directly from his park to his
house, with the assistance of my horsemen and
others. I think he will require to be assisted
with my guard of soldiers, who may take their
board and lodging in the village adjoining, and
because the house is of no strength, if I were
in Sir Walter Aston's place I would have some
stronger guard.”</p>

<p>“Have you already sufficient instructions for
requesting the assistance of the well-affected
gentlemen, and if not, then to advise what further
commission required?”</p>

<p><i>Reply</i>: “I have already Her Majesty's commission
for levying forces.”</p>

<p>“Have a watchful eye over your charge, and in
such sort as may create no suspicion.”</p>

<p><i>Reply</i>: “This shall be performed as near as I
may.”</p>

<p>“That the extraordinary posts be commanded
to use more diligence, and for that purpose to
keep two horses in the house for the packets.”</p>

<p><i>Reply</i>: “It seemeth meet that this order come
from you, and I will also require it.”</p>

<p>“Your opinion touching the gentlemen in that
county and in other counties next adjoining who
are well affected and fit to be used in this enterprise.”</p>

<p><i>Reply</i>:
“I have lived as a prisoner in this
country, and therefore not well acquainted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the state thereof; but I have a very good opinion
of Sir Walter Aston, Mr. Bagott, and Mr.
Greysley, all three neighbours. Mr. Trentham is
one of the lieutenants of this shire, and of very
good report, but I have had little to do with him.”</p>

<p>“Consider what order shall be taken with the
unnecessary number of her servants, especially
with young Pierrepont.”</p>

<p><i>Reply</i>: “Although I take Mr. Melville to be
free from all practices, and indeed liveth as a
stranger to his own company and hateth Nau
deadly, yet I think he should be removed from
his Mistress to some gentleman's house.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This paper is preserved in the State Paper
Office, and is an authentic proof that the kidnapping
outrage was carried out at the desire and by
the personal order of Queen Elizabeth. The
instructions given in the paper would not have
been believed if the paper had not been preserved.
In all this Elizabeth was deliberately violating the
laws of England and the eternal principles of
justice.</p>

<p>The Queen of Scots was not her subject. She
had no jurisdiction over her, and the seizing of
her papers was, in the circumstances, simply an
act of highway robbery, punishable in the case of a
subject with death.</p>

<p>At this date (9th August 1586) the plot for the
kidnapping must have occupied Elizabeth's whole
attention. She had evidently become doubtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
as to whether Paulet was equal to the occasion,
and whether the commission with which she had
intrusted him was not too much for his capability.
It was to his credit that she doubted his sincerity
and ability concerning this infamous scheme. It
will be observed that Paulet's orders of 3rd
August were duplicated by Elizabeth on 9th
August, so determined was she that nothing should
prevent the plot being carried out.</p>

<p>The records of the time are incomplete, and
leave us to conjecture what public feeling was.
It was impossible for the nation to concur with
Elizabeth's administration regarding this matter,
and we observe that no expression of approval or
disapproval was allowed to be recorded.</p>

<p>The next paper recorded is dated 9th August
and is entitled “A Memorial of Things to be
done about the Removal (kidnapping) of the
Scottish Queen. Instructions for Sir Amias
Paulet.” This paper, which we reproduce, is in
the handwriting of Walsingham, and is followed
by one from Elizabeth accentuating the instructions
already conveyed to Paulet:—</p>

<p>“Remove her under colour of some good
excuse before arresting Nau and Curle or seizing
papers. Take her to some house near Chartley
where the inhabitants are known to be best
affected to us. The owner of the house to be
removed where the Scottish Queen shall stay for
a time. Appoint standing watches in the towns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
for a time and the well-affected Justices to assist
in the thoroughfares. Gorges to repair to Stafford
or some place near Chartley to seal the study.
He to conduct the prisoners and to be assisted by
Francis Hast. Have some gentlemen of credit
at the search writings and send up some trusty
servants with the same in the company of
Wade.</p>

<p>“Search Nau and Curle's chests and take order
with Pierrepont.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Following on this communication of Walsingham
the English Queen sent her own instructions as
follows:—</p>

<p>Instructions of Elizabeth to Sir Amias Paulet
about the removal of the Queen of Scots, the
apprehending of Nau and Curle and the seizure
of their papers, 9th August 1586:</p>

<p>“You shall, with as convenient speed as you
may, under the colour of going a-hunting and
taking the air, remove the Queen, your charge, to
some such house near to the place where she now
remaineth as you shall think meet for her to stay
in for a time until you shall understand our further
pleasure. And to the end that she may be kept
from all means of intelligence: we think that the
owner of the house where you place her shall be
removed, saving such persons as are to furnish
necessaries of the household. You shall between
Chartley and the place where you mean to remove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
her, as is contained in our letters, cause her
servants Nau and Curle to be apprehended, and
to be delivered into the hands of some trusty
gentleman of that county or the counties next
adjoining, as you shall know to be discreet,
faithful, and religious, for H—— B—— to conduct
them to London with some convenient guard,
where there shall be order given for the placing of
them.</p>

<p>“You shall also take order with the conductors
to see them brought up in two separate troops,
and to have special care that they may be kept
from conference with any person on their way to
London, and to appoint in the places where they
lodge good standing watches to be kept during
the night.</p>

<p>“You shall immediately after she is departed
from Chartley cause all such papers as are found
either in her own lodging or in the lodgings of
any that appertain to her (taking care that all
secret corners in the lodging be diligently searched)
to be seized and to be put up in bags or trunks
as you shall think meet, for execution of which
service you shall use besides our servant Wade
two principal gentlemen of credit either of that
county or of some other county adjoining. For
which purpose we think John Manners the elder
and Sir Walter Aston suitable to be used if they
be found in the country, or some of like quality.
These we would have in no way made acquainted
with the said service until the Queen shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
removed and they brought to the place when and
where you shall think suitable to be performed.
You shall cause the said gentlemen, together with
Wade, to seal up with their seals of arms the said
bags or trunks where the letters and papers shall
be placed: and to send up two of their trusty
servants together with Wade with the said writings.</p>

<p>“You shall do well during the time of her
abode in the house she is taken to, to cause some
substantial watches to be kept both about the
house as also in the town next adjoining; wherein
we doubt not but you will have a special regard to
use the service of such of the Justices and gentlemen
in that county as are well affected, giving
them special orders to choose well-affected men
as watchers, and not such as are known to be
recusants.</p>

<p>“And whereas our meaning is that hereafter
she shall not have such a number of attendants
as she has had, we think you should make choice
of as many of her train, both men and women, as
you shall see necessary to attend on her person;
and for the rest they should be kept together at
Chartley in such a manner as there shall be no
access to them, until you shall understand our
further pleasure.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>All this shows how deliberately the kidnapping
scheme was carried out.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth to Paulet, 9th August 1586.
Final orders to kidnap:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>“We having of late discovered some dangerous
practices, tending not only to the troubling of our
estate but to the peril of our own person, whereof
we have just cause to judge the Queen, your
charge, and her two secretaries, Nau and Curle,
to have been parties and assenting in a most
unprincely and unnatural sense, contrary to our
expectations, considering the great and earnest
protestations she hath made of the sincerity of
her love and goodwill to us. Our pleasure therefore
is that you cause the two secretaries to be
apprehended and to be sent up to us under good
and sure guard, and that you take the said Queen
to some such place as you shall think meet, and
there to see her straitly kept with so many of her
train to attend on her as you shall think necessary
until you understand our further pleasure.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span>
the 16th August, what may be called the
kidnapping of the Queen took place, and reference
is made to Bourgoyne, pp. 160-70, for details.
It will be observed how adroitly Gorges, a
subaltern of Elizabeth's, suddenly stopped the
Queen and delivered one of Elizabeth's insolent
messages, charging her with the violation of an
agreement which never existed and with a conspiracy
against Elizabeth's life in which Elizabeth
herself was known to be involved. This was
her pretext for her treatment of the Scottish
Queen, and ordering her servants to be seized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and separated from her. Mary indignantly replied,
“Far from having conspired against the Queen,
I have never even had such a thought.” This
availed nothing, and her followers were thereupon
apprehended. The “Stag-hunt” manœuvre was
successful in enticing her away from Chartley, and
affording Paulet and his satellites an opportunity
of carrying out the kidnapping plot and afterwards
breaking into her private apartments in her
absence, forcing open her cabinets, and carrying
away her papers, letters, and all private documents.
Bourgoyne tells the story at considerable length,
and a pitiable story it is. Then when she discovered
they were not returning to Chartley, that
she was in fact being kidnapped, she sat down
on the road and refused to remount her horse till
she knew where she was being taken. Her
offering up prayer under an adjoining tree, supported
by Bourgoyne and Elizabeth Curle, is one
of the most pathetic incidents of her life, and we
are indebted to Bourgoyne for the narrative and
for the words of the prayer which he has given
from memory. We cannot realise at this distance
of time the overwhelming agony of the poor
captive bereft of her friends and attendants, held
prisoner by a tyrant; being kidnapped and taken
she knew not where, alike ignorant whether life
or death awaited her. No one need be surprised
that in such circumstances she appealed to the
Almighty. Bourgoyne stood by her and rendered
her noble support. He immediately discussed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
situation with Paulet, and evidently made some
impression on the heart of that heartless individual.
It drew from Paulet the expression that the
Queen would experience no harm. Paulet in an
arbitrary manner took her confidential and devoted
attendants from her: Nau and Curle, Melville
and Bourgoyne. These were arrested and not
allowed any more to accompany her; in short,
Nau and Curle never saw her again. There is an
important discovery brought to light here, namely,
that the Queen had at this date lost all confidence
in her secretary Nau because he had become unfaithful
and disloyal to her. His conduct after
he was taken to London was not only that of
a traitor, but he actually made to Walsingham
the most unfounded accusations against her.</p>

<p>After the kidnapping of the Queen, one of
Elizabeth's attendants named Nicasino Yetsweirt
wrote Walsingham on 21st August informing him
that Elizabeth approved the order taken for the
safe custody of Nau and Curle, and the things
that Gorges and Wade had charge of, besides
caskets with writings:—</p>

<p>“Her Majesty was anxious to have those
caskets safely brought, and she was informed that
a discreet person was despatched to assist Gorges
and Wade in their charge. She was not satisfied
with that, and would have you to provide yet
better herein, and specially that the caskets might
be brought under sure conduct and by sure persons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
for Her Highness attaches more importance
to them and their contents than to Nau and
Curle. Little she esteemeth them in comparison
with the caskets.</p>

<p>“The French Ambassador and Monsieur
Deshcool, who is come out of Scotland, had
audience today, and Her Majesty said she never
saw a man more perplexed than the Ambassador
when he was about to speak. Every joint in his
body did shake and his countenance changed, and
specially when this intended enterprise was mentioned
by her. Whereupon, seeming to take more
heart to himself, he said, 'I would have moved
some suite unto you, but I see your Majesty is
somewhat troubled with these <i>jeunes follastres</i>
(young fools) that are apprehended.' 'Yea,' said
Her Majesty, 'they are such <i>jeunes follastres</i> as
some of them may spend ten and twenty thousand
francs of Rentes and it may be that there are
some who may spend more.' Her Majesty
seemeth afraid that this Ambassador might devise
some mischievous means to disturb the quiet and
sure bringing up of these men, and the things just
rescued, whereupon she desired me to warn you
that special care be taken thereof.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This letter forms a link in the chain of the
kidnapping outrage and shows the hand of
Elizabeth as presumably the head of it. Nau
and Curle were sent under a guard to London
(Westminster Palace Prison). From that prison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
they witnessed on 20th September the cruel execution
of Babington and one-half of his companions
in Palace Yard, including Savage and Ballard;
the other half were executed the following day
at Tyburn. They admitted ciphering three
letters to Babington from minutes alleged to have
been written by Queen Mary. On Phillips' decipherment
of the one dated 17th July, they said
it was the same or like it, and signed an attestation
to that effect. Nau, however, privily wrote a
narrative of Mary's proceedings in the matter,
fully exonerating himself and her from ever practising
against Elizabeth's life. This he succeeded
in getting delivered into Elizabeth's own hands, to
the surprise and displeasure of Burghley, to whom
it was shown by her. Burghley endorsed the
narrative (contemptuously), “Nau's long declaration
of things of no importance, sent privately to
the Queen's Majesty.” In another endorsement
suspicion is expressed as to how Nau got this
letter put into Elizabeth's hands. Surprise should
rather have been expressed that Elizabeth, having
received such a letter, should have proceeded
with the execution of her royal captive. Nau,
from his influential position of private secretary
to Queen Mary, was able to speak with authority
on this point, and it was the first duty of the
English Queen after receiving such a letter to
make a searching investigation into the circumstances
and find out the truth. If Mary was
innocent, she ought to have been released on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
spot. Nothing evidently would induce Elizabeth
to liberate her. This letter was disregarded and
the bogus indictment against Mary was proceeded
with as if no such letter had been written.</p>

<p>On 24th August 1586 Paulet wrote Walsingham
touching on the outrage of 16th August, desiring
instructions as to the disposal of Nau and Curle's
servants and the removal of Mary to Chartley.
This letter is of no moment save as forming part
of the record of that event:—</p>

<p>“Forasmuch as you required me by order from
Elizabeth to acquaint her of what hath passed
between this lady (Queen Mary) and me in the
execution of the late charge, as also how she hath
behaved herself since the apprehension of her
secretaries, I have considered that the sooner I
performed this duty the better it would be, and
therefore I send to you enclosed my letter to Her
Highness (Elizabeth). You will consider what
shall be done with Nau's servant, who is of this
country and came to his service from Pierrepont,
and with Curle's servant, who is a Scot, they both
being now unnecessary.</p>

<p>“Touching the residue of the Scottish family, I
will send you a note of their names and charges,
so that you may consider as to removing as you
shall think proper.</p>

<p>“It is intended that this lady (Queen Mary)
shall remove to Chartley to-morrow, where this
household can have no long continuance without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
imminent danger and extreme charge to Her
Majesty in many things this winter, as provision
has not been made beforehand. I hear of traitors
that are carried towards you every day—God be
thanked for it.</p>

<p>“From Tixall, 24th August 1586.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Walsingham's letter to Paulet under date 5th
September was in the following terms:—</p>

<p>“Her Majesty continues her firm resolution to
have that lady's money seized and her servants
divided from her, as you may perceive by the
enclosed extract of a letter I received this morning
from Mr. Wade; and therefore, her pleasure being
thus, I do not see why you should any longer forbear
the putting of the same into execution. If
afterwards inconveniences happen therefor, Her
Majesty can blame none but herself.</p>

<p>“I am now absent from court by reason of
inflammation in my leg grown of the pain of a
boil, and therefore I cannot debate the matter
with Her Majesty as I would. This afternoon
the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer, and the
Vice-Chamberlain meet at London. You shall be
advised of the resolution that will be taken either
for the removing of that lady to Fotheringay or
bringing her directly hither to the Tower.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Enclosure accompanying the foregoing letter:—</p>

<p>“Points to be considered in the proceedings
against the Queen of Scots:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whether any tho ... ys ought to be on
publication of the commission.</p>

<p>“Whether the accusation shall be by writing or
<i>ore tenne</i>, and by whom.</p>

<p>“If she will not answer.</p>

<p>“If she will require counsel.</p>

<p>“If she will require time to answer.</p>

<p>“If she will require to come to the Parliament
House.</p>

<p>“If she will require to hear the accusers.</p>

<p>“Whether it shall be convenient to admit the
accusers to maintain the accusation upon their
voluntary oath, being partakers in the accusation
being criminal.</p>

<p>“Whether the commission may not be adjourned
to any place to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>“Whether any entry or record shall be made of
the proceedings, and whether in Latin or English.</p>

<p>“Whether she shall be dealt with by the name
of Mary, late Queen of Scots, or by what name.</p>

<p>“Whether the sentence must be given there or
upon an adjournment to any other place.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>The kidnapping having been carried out and
completed, Elizabeth before the end of August
sent the following fulsome expression of gratitude
to Paulet for the manner in which he had done his
duty. The text of this curious letter is evidently
founded on the material introduced by Walsingham
into Mary's letter to Babington of 17th July.
Elizabeth, there is reason to believe, knew about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
this and was responsible along with Walsingham
for the consequences. No such language was ever
before or since applied to the Queen of Scots:—</p>

<p>“Amias, my most faithful and careful servant,
God reward thee treblefold in three double, for thy
most troublesome charge so well discharged; if
you knew (my Amias) how kindly besides dutifully
my grateful heart accepteth and praiseth your
spotless action, your wise orders, and safe regards,
performed in so dangerous and crafty a charge, it
would ease your travails and rejoice your heart;
in which I charge you to carry this most just
thought, that I cannot balance in any weight of
my judgment the value that I prize you at, and
suppose no treasure to countervail such a faith,
and shall condemn myself in that fault which yet
I never committed if I reward not such deserts,
yea let me lack when I most need if I acknowledge
not such a merit with a reward. <i>Non omnibus
est datum.</i> Let your wicked murderess know
how with hearty sorrow her vile deserts compel
these orders, and bid her from me ask God's
forgiveness for her treacherous dealings towards
the saver of her life, many a year, to the intolerable
peril of her own; and yet not contented with
so many forgivenesses, must fall again so horrible,
far passing a woman's thought much less a
Princess. And instead of excusing (whereof not
one can serve, it being so plainly confessed by the
author of my innocent death) let repentance take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
place, and let the fiend possess her, so as her
better part be lost, which I pray for with hands
lifted up to Him that may both save and spill.—With
my most loving adieu and prayers for thy
long life, your most assured and loving Sovereign,</p>

</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This letter, which is a further development of
Elizabeth's policy, was immediately followed by
one from Walsingham to Paulet dated 25th August
intimating the Queen's great commendation of
him and approving the proposal of removing the
Scottish Queen back to Chartley, but she is to be
treated as a prisoner. It will be noticed in all
this that Lord Burghley is conspicuous by his
absence, Elizabeth and Walsingham being solely
responsible for Mary's treatment at this period:—</p>

<p>“Gorges and Wade came safely to London on
Sunday at night with their several charges, and
Her Majesty is marvellously well satisfied with
the care and endeavours that you have exercised
in the search of the house (Chartley). She approves
of removing your charge to Chartley for
the reasons you give of the strength of the house
and the easing the country of their continual
watches. But upon report made by Wade of the
unsoundness of the country, Her Majesty meaneth
that your charge (the Queen of Scots) shall be
shortly conveyed to some other place, and not
there remain with so much liberty as she enjoyeth,
but in the state of a prisoner attended only with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
few persons, such as she must have of necessity.
Therefore Her Majesty would have you to consider
to what number the said persons may be
restricted. I mean to know Her Majesty's
pleasure touching the priest whom in the meanwhile
you have done well to detain in Gresley's
house. And you shall also know what is to be
done with young Pierrepont and Melville. For
young Pasquier, Her Majesty would have you
send him here under sure guard such as to you
shall seem convenient, because it is supposed he
was privy to the writing of those letters that were
in cypher.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>During Mary's captivity Elizabeth committed a
series of crimes or cruelties against her, but these
pale into insignificance as against the kidnapping
outrage and the final scene at Fotheringay. In
all the circumstances, what is there to excuse or
explain this policy? In vain will the student of
history investigate the matter, for explanation
there is none. Elizabeth resolved that the time
had come when the Scottish Queen should be
removed to the place of her destruction—Fotheringay.
Lord Burghley, who now appears
on the scene, and Walsingham, were intrusted
with the management and execution of the scheme
which was to become the greatest tragedy in
English history. These men on 26th August
instructed Paulet as follows:—</p>

<p>“The Queen's Majesty, on information given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to her by Wade, has resolved to have the Queen
your charge removed to some other place of more
safety, and for that purpose hath thought upon
Fotheringay Castle in Northamptonshire, and asks
us to consider of such things as are necessary
for the removal. We have directed Sir Walter
Mildmay to inspect the said castle and certify us
of the state thereof, and how the household may
be furnished with necessary provisions and wood
and coal, and with a suitable quantity of beer from
some brewer in the town of Fotheringay or otherwise.
You will likewise send either Darell or
some other apt person thither, accompanied with
one of the wardrobe, to consider in what sort the
stuffs and hangings that are now with you may
furnish some convenient lodging for the Queen.
It is not meant that she shall henceforth have that
scope and liberty that heretofore she has enjoyed,
but remain in the state of a prisoner, with some
regard nevertheless to her degree and quality.
Other particulars wherein we desire to be informed
we have set down in the enclosed
articles, wherein we pray you that you will reply
immediately. What number of servants both
of men and women will be sufficient to attend
upon the Queen of Scots' person being kept
as a prisoner, and how many of those that
she hath attendant now upon her may be
spared? The names and quality as well of
such as shall attend as of such as are to be
dismissed to be set down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>“How she is furnished of coach and litters for
the removal both of herself and those who shall
attend upon her.</p>

<p>“In how many days the removal from Chartley
to Fotheringay may be performed (it is thought
here that the readiest way is by Leicester), having
regard to the sickly state of her body.</p>

<p>“What well-affected gentlemen there are
between Chartley and Fotheringay who have convenient
houses to lodge the said Queen, wherein
Sir Walter Mildmay's advice shall be used.</p>

<p>“Whether it shall not be convenient for her to
stay two or three days in Leicestershire or in some
convenient place in Northamptonshire until the
said house may be put in readiness, wherein Sir
Walter's advice is also to be used, by sending
some discreet person from you to him.</p>

<p>“Under what guard she should be conveyed until
she comes into Leicestershire, where the country
being sound you shall need the less assistance.</p>

<p>“If you are furnished with money for this
removal, and if not what sum you will require.
There is now orders given for your man to receive
£600 or £700 here at London. You are to
decide how soon she should be removed.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>In continuation of this correspondence we have
the following communication dated the succeeding
day from Paulet to Walsingham referring to the
removal of the Queen from Sir Walter Aston's
house at Tixall to Chartley conducted by Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Walter, Mr. Gresley, Mr. Chetwynd, and others;
the Queen's visit to Curle's wife and baptizing
Curle's child:—</p>

<p>“This lady was removed hither on the 25th of
this month by Sir Walter Aston, Mr. Bagott, Mr.
Gresley, Mr. Littleton, Mr. Chetwynd, and others
to the number of one hundred and forty horses
at the least. At the coming out of Sir Walter
Aston's gate she said with a low voice, weeping,
to some poor folks who were there assembled, 'I
have nothing for you; I am a beggar as well as
you; all is taken from me,' and when she came to
the gentlemen she said, weeping, 'Good gentlemen,
I am not witting or privy to anything intended
against the Queen.' She visited Curle's wife
(who was delivered of child in her absence)
before she went to her own chamber, bidding
her to be of good comfort, and that she would
answer for her husband in all things that might
be objected against him. Curle's child remaining
unchristened, and the priest removed before the
arrival of this lady, she desired that my minister
might baptize the child with such godfathers and
godmothers as I would procure, so as the child
might bear her name. This being refused, she
came shortly after into Curle's wife's chamber, and
laying the child on her knee, she took water out
of the basin, and casting it upon the face of the
child said, 'Mary, I baptize thee in the name of
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,' calling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the child by her own name Mary. This may not
be found strange in her who maketh no conscience
to break the laws of God and man.</p>

<p>“At the coming hither Mr. Darell delivered
the keys as well of her chamber as of her coffers
to Bastian, which he refused by direction from
his mistress, who required Mr. Darell to open her
chamber door, which he did; and then this lady,
finding that her papers were taken away, said in
great choler that two things could not be taken
from her: her English blood and her Catholic
religion, which both she would keep until her
death, adding further these words: 'Some of you
will be sorry for it,' meaning the taking away of
her papers. I was not present when these words
were spoken, but no doubt they reached me, in
what sense she only knoweth. I may be sorry
for others, but I know there is nothing in her
papers that can give me cause to be sorry for
myself. I am deceived also that she is not hasty
to see me or speak with me, only she sent to
know if I would convey her letter to Her Majesty,
which I refused, saying that no letters should pass
out of this house without orders from above.
She made the like request at Sir Walter Aston's
house, which I also refused and desired your
direction thereon. I received yours of the 25th,
by which you continue to increase my joy by your
report of Her Majesty's gracious acceptance of
my unworthy services. God be thanked that so
many of the principal conspirators are apprehended,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and God make us thankful for his
singular mercies.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>It is possible Paulet did not know of the interpolations
on Queen Mary's letters. He was evidently
outside the select circle which carried them out.
The close of this letter would indicate that he,
being outside of it, was convinced of the complicity
of Mary in the Babington Plot. He never for a
moment suspected the sincerity of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>When Mary reached Chartley from Tixall on
25th August she found her coffers and desks
rifled and all her papers and jewels taken away.
One cabinet in her bedroom, strange to say, had
been overlooked, and it contained her money.
Paulet wrote immediately to Walsingham, the
result being that Paulet and Richard Bagot, a
magistrate, on receipt of Walsingham's reply,
rudely entered the presence of Mary, intimating
that they were commanded to take her money,
and advised her to deliver it up quietly. Mary
emphatically refused to comply, and declared she
would not give up the key. Paulet called his
servants and told them to bring bars to break
open the door. Seeing the uselessness of further
resistance, she submitted, and saw him seize five
rolls of canvas, containing five thousand French
crowns, two leather bags, one having £104 in
gold and the other £3 in silver; the silver he
left with her. In Nau's chamber he found two
bags, one with £900 and the other with £286,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and a chain valued at £100. In Curle's chamber
he found two canvas rolls each containing one
thousand crowns; they were Queen Mary's gift
to Mrs. Curle on her marriage. Paulet sealed and
took possession of them in Elizabeth's name, and
delivered them into Bagot's charge.
<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This was another of the disreputable transactions
carried out by Elizabeth's orders. The
question may very naturally be asked, What right
had she to break into lockfast places and seize
the money and jewels, etc., of the Scottish Queen?
If a subject behaved in this manner he would be
immediately arrested and punished.</p>

<p>It is important at this crisis to know what
letters passed between Paulet and Walsingham.
We are in possession of only some of these, and
the information they convey is that a gigantic
scheme was progressing for the murder of the
Scottish Queen, and that these men were the
puppets of Elizabeth for accomplishing her design.
What is obvious is that Paulet's letters were
written with profound caution—almost terror—lest
he should offend his mistress. His letters
and his treatment of the Queen show that to her
he was both cunning and false, alike destitute of
the honour of a gentleman and of those feelings
of humanity which are essential to a man intrusted
with the delicate duty of custodian of a Queen.
Only once did he show that he realised his responsibility,
when in a letter to Walsingham of 30th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
August he desired to be relieved of his onerous
duty. The letters were in the following terms:—</p>

<p>Paulet to Walsingham:</p>

<p>“It may please your Honour to be advised
that, receiving your letters of the 26th and 28th
of the month, I have, according to your direction,
despatched Mr. Darell this morning towards
Fotheringay for the views of the lodgings there,
which no doubt will be furnished with the
hangings belonging to this house, whereof there
is a good store of all sorts of length and breadth.
I send herewith my opinion touching your article
addressed unto me, and have sent the copy as
well of the articles as of my postills to Sir Walter
Mildmay, so that he may supply all the defects
by his better judgment and knowledge of these
countries. I think myself happy for many causes
to be removed out of this country, and now I
should think myself twice happy if this Queen
with the change of lodgings might also change her
keeper; and indeed a gentleman of that country
might supply this place with less expense to Her
Majesty and better surety of his charge, having his
servants, tenants, and good neighbours at hand.</p>

<p>“Although I am bold to write as I wish, yet
I will never desire it, but as it may stand with
Her Majesty's good pleasure as one that embraceth
all Her Highness's commands with all willing
obedience.</p>

<p>“From Chartley, 30th August 1586.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>And again, on 15th September, Paulet said:</p>

<p>“I find by your letter of the 12th, received last
night at midnight, that you were not acquainted
with my Lord Treasurer's first and second letters
to me of the 8th, the contents whereof may appear
unto you by my answer of the same sent to his
Lordship. I find this lady very willing to remove
so as to hear often from the French Ambassador,
by reason that her lodging is within thirty miles
of London; and now twenty carts are appointed to
be laden here this next morrow, and I think we
shall remove from hence about the middle of this
next week, if we be not stayed by contrary news,
whereof I thought good to advise you. Since my
last letters to you I have found in a casket in
Nau's chamber £5, 10s. in gold and £1, 7s. 3d.
in white money, and among the same the silver
piece enclosed, by which you may easily judge of
his malicious, cankered, and traitorous heart
towards Her Majesty. All this Queen's seals
were in this casket, which are in great numbers,
and two serve for privy packets and all other
purposes.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This letter was immediately followed by one of
considerable importance from Queen Mary to the
Duke of Guise, September 1586:—</p>

<p>“My good cousin, if God do not help you to
find means of aiding your poor cousin, it is all
over this time. The bearer will tell you how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
they treat me and my two secretaries. For
God's sake help and save them if you can.
We are accused of having wished to disturb the
State, and of having practised against the life
of the Queen or consented to it; but I have
asserted what is true, that I know nothing of
it. It is said that some letters have been seized
in the possession of one Babington, one Charles
Paget, and his brother, which testify to the
conspiracy, and that Nau and Curle have confessed
it. I maintain that they could not do so
unless more than they know were forced out of
them by means of torture.”</p>

<p>(This confession was the result of the rack.)</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Pasquier or de Pasquier, a literary friend and
follower of Mary, was apprehended along with
Nau and Curle for no reason whatever, and very
shortly after that event he was brought before
the Lord Chancellor to see what secret information
about Mary they could possibly draw out of
him. As he was in reality a member of Mary's
household, Elizabeth's ministers were sanguine
that they would get important information. In
that, however, they were disappointed, as Pasquier
was able to keep his own counsel. On 2nd
September 1586 he appeared before the Lord
Chancellor, when the following interrogatories were
put to him, but we have no answers recorded.
These cunning questions were in the interest of
Elizabeth, and constitute a mean attempt on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the part of Bromley to drag the Scottish Queen
into trouble:—</p>

<p>“Whether he has been at any time acquainted
with the practice for the setting of the Scottish
Queen at liberty?</p>

<p>“Whether he has not been made acquainted
with some practice within the realm of disposing
the hearts of Catholics to join with such foreign
forces as should invade the realm?</p>

<p>“Whether he has not within these four or
five months written letters to certain persons in
foreign parts to show how the Catholics of this
realm stood affected with them?</p>

<p>“What practice he has been made acquainted
with in these three months prejudicial to Her
Majesty's State or person?</p>

<p>“How he knoweth that the Queen of Scots has
had her secret letters carried or brought to her?”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>In the midst of these negotiations Walsingham
appears to have had another subject on hand: this
was the relations between Mary and her son.</p>

<p>It need not be the least surprising that
Walsingham should have written the following
false and calumnious letter to the Master of
Gray, dated 15th September. If he could surreptitiously
open, copy, and interpolate Queen
Mary's letters, he was quite capable of giving
the advice contained in this communication.
This Master of Gray was one of Mary's
enemies, and was mainly instrumental in putting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
discord between mother and son. No man knew
better than Walsingham that Mary was innocent
of Darnley's murder, but to admit this would
be to jeopardise his scheme for her execution.
Consequently her innocence could not be entertained.
Mary losing her Crown had nothing
whatever to do with the Darnley murder. She
never voluntarily gave up the Crown, but it was
compulsorily taken from her by Lindsay and
Ruthven when she was confined in Loch Leven
in 1567, in order that Moray might assume the
Regency:—</p>

<p>“I thank you for sounding the King's disposition,
how he could be content to have the
Queen his mother proceeded against for the
late fact, but I suppose it will be in vain to
move him any further, because he may conceive
it would be <i>contra bonos mores</i>, in respect of the
bond of nature between them, that he should
make himself a party against her. Nevertheless,
you may with good reason persuade him that he
make no mediation for her, or oppose himself
against the course that is intended to be adopted
with her, considering the hard treatment that his
father received at her hands, for which detestable
deed she was deprived of her Crown. It is
meant that she shall be tried here according to
the Act made in the last Parliament, and that
agreeably to the contents of the said Act certain
noblemen shall be appointed to charge her, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
assembled for that purpose the 27th of this
month, and shall be with her by the 4th of the
next at Fotheringay Castle, seven miles from
Stamford, whither she is appointed to be brought.
But the matters whereof she is guilty are already
so plain and manifest, being also confessed by her
two secretaries, as it is thought they shall require
no long debating. We suppose she will appeal and

in this case neither by the civil law nor by the
laws of this realm can be available.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Bourgoyne's <i>Journal</i> exposes the cruelty of
Queen Mary's enemies and their importunity
about the Babington Conspiracy, and while she
protested that during her captivity “Elizabeth
had maintained, sustained, and aided her rebel
subjects, alienated her son from her, and taken
away what she possessed,” and could prove this,
they would not listen to it, but wanted to squeeze
out of her something that would incriminate herself.</p>

<p>The following paper, which is in the handwriting
of Phillips, one of Walsingham's spies, is preserved
in the Record Office under date September 1586.
It is reproduced not because it is of any value, but
rather to show the persistent and cunning efforts
to entrap the Scottish Queen. It concerns the
Babington Conspiracy, and is a wholly unauthenticated
document. The papers Phillips refers to
are from Mary's cabinets, seized on the day she
was kidnapped; and in order to understand the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
object of the paper, we must keep in view that
it assumes the accuracy of Mary's interpolated
letter of 17th July to Babington. In short, it
was Phillips, the writer of this paper, who was the
copyist of these interpolations.</p>

<p>Bereft of these, any plot against Elizabeth by
Mary is the merest fable and cannot be proved;
and what remains is a series of enterprises for
the release <i>simpliciter</i> of the Scottish Queen.
Mary was connected only with schemes for her
own liberty, and for that she cannot be blamed.
This paper is a laboured and wicked attempt to
induce posterity to believe that she was hatching
plots for Elizabeth's murder and an invasion of
England. There is no proof to defend this
charge:—</p>

<p>“Memorial showing how the ten parcels of
extracts and copies of the Scottish Queen's
intercepted letters delivered to Wotton are to be

and stirring rebellion within the land, proposed
and wrought by Charles Paget, Ballard, and

her acceptance and approbation of the whole.</p>

the Catholics of England to join with foreign
forces for the execution of an enterprise to the
disturbance of the present State.</p>

<p>“That she allowed and embraced the same
(this was a plan for her own liberty).</p>

<p>“That she thereupon made them an ample

be referred to in order to understand the matter.

set Savage at work to kill Elizabeth, and was
to have come over to effect the same (Phillips
is founding on the interpolations); that he was
privy to Ballard coming into England and the
cause, Ballard also was a practiser against the
Queen's person (Elizabeth).</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>After reading this paper the reader will naturally
suppose that the Queen of Scots was a wicked
person to get up an agitation among the Catholics
of France and Spain for the invasion of England
and the consequent removal of Elizabeth from the
English Crown. That such were the wishes of
the Catholics will not be denied, but the connection
of Mary with such a revolutionary scheme
was one of the cleverest acts of Walsingham and
Phillips the spy. We have printed six letters in
the appendix, which are of great importance in
considering this complexion of the matter. No. vi.,
which is a genuine letter of the Queen, should
be read first. In it, though dated so late as 27th
July, there is no reference to such a thing, and
Mendoza was one of her most confidential friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
The paper which we have just reproduced is
evidently founded on Nos. i. and v., Queen Mary
to Charles Paget. These two letters are in the
State Paper Office in the handwriting of Phillips,
and may be set down as forgeries. We have no
evidence save that of Phillips that Queen Mary
wrote these two letters, and until reliable proof
is produced they must be regarded as bogus
productions. Whether Paget wrote No. ii. it is
impossible to determine.</p>

<p>In the investigation of this matter we have
to bear in mind that the Babington Conspiracy
and the Babington Plot were two separate and
distinct schemes. The former was for the
assassination of Elizabeth, fabricated and tacked
on by Walsingham to Babington's letter proposing
Mary's liberation; the latter was Babington's
plot for Mary's liberation only and for nothing
else, which neither Babington nor Mary ever
denied.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span>
Queen Mary's pathetic letters to the
French and Spanish Ambassadors at the end of
July (see pp. 304-5) no further communications of
hers are to be found for four months. On 23rd
November she received official notice of her
death sentence, and on that overwhelming occasion
she wrote to the Pope, to Henry <i>III.</i>, to the Duke
of Guise and the Archbishop of Glasgow, informing
them of the appalling event. What happened
to her during these four months is so far recorded
by Bourgoyne. It was a painful and exciting
period for her and her household. The State
Paper Office as regards Mary is practically silent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
for the time, but Elizabeth and her court were in
a state of great activity.</p>

<p>In order to understand the situation, it will be
necessary to make a brief reference to the events
of these four months. The time was mainly
occupied with schemes of Walsingham for getting
the Scottish Queen involved in the so-called
Babington Conspiracy. These plots were conceived
and developed with all the skill and
audacity of men educated for the work. Walsingham
and Phillips the spy occupied the chess-board,
and their object was to “checkmate the
Queen.” A startling move took place on 2nd
August, when Phillips desired Walsingham to
order Babington's arrest; and on the following day
Francis Myles wrote Walsingham recommending
Ballard's apprehension, while Phillips asked a
warrant to do so. Same day Babington announced
to Queen Mary the treachery of one of
his companions (Maude), and begged her not to
falter, as it was an honourable enterprise (his plot
for her release): “What they could and would
they would perform or die.” This letter has
been copied three times by Walsingham's spies
who intercepted Mary's letters, and this shows
how important these men regarded it as a weapon
against herself. Their actions were prompt.
Then came the kidnapping plot, when the Scottish
Queen was taken she knew not where. There is
also recorded the so-called confessions of Savage
as to the Babington Plot and his knowledge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
those who practised against Elizabeth. This
paper is in the handwriting of Phillips, which
suggests forgery. A few days later, namely, on
20th August, Courcelles wrote Pinart that forces
were being levied in Scotland to aid Elizabeth, and
that they were under the command of the Master
of Gray. On 4th September Walsingham wrote
Phillips that Curle admits receipt of Babington's
letters and the Queen of Scots' answer; Phillips
to see Elizabeth and get her orders as to granting
her favour to Curle in the hope of drawing information
out of him. On the same day Walsingham
acquainted Paulet with Elizabeth's
orders as to Mary's treatment: “They are in
consultation about having her brought to the
Tower and proceeded against according to statute
made in last Parliament.” On the same day are
recorded Nau and Curle's confessions about
Mary's letter to Babington (in the handwriting
of Phillips). On 10th September Nau wrote
Elizabeth that he knew nothing whatever of the
enterprise more than is contained in the enclosed,
which protests that Queen Mary had no connection
whatever with the design of Babington
and others. There is a vacancy of seventeen
days on the Record, and on 27th September it
is recorded that Burghley ordered Walsingham
to send Phillips for certain letters which would
be wanted at the meeting of the lords next
morning.</p>

<p>After a fatiguing journey of four days under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
much privation and suffering, Queen Mary arrived
at Fotheringay on Sunday, 25th September. The
journey is fully described by Bourgoyne. For a
week after her arrival there are no entries in the
<i>Journal</i>, from which we infer that she was for that
period undisturbed by her persecutors. But on
the following Saturday, 1st October, the dark
shadow of Elizabeth was felt at Fotheringay.
Paulet, in his usual insolent manner, communicated
to Mary one of Elizabeth's characteristic messages:
“That she had sufficient proof to contradict what
Mary had said to Gorges” (see Bourgoyne,
p. 189). She was careful, however, never to
produce that proof. These words were doubtless
an invention for the purpose of enabling her to
convey what really was the message: “That the
Queen of England was to send some lords and
counsellors to speak to her,” <i>e.g.</i> Mary's trial and
condemnation. Elizabeth at this date had
evidently resolved on Mary's execution and how
she was to accomplish it. On the same day
Paulet again had an interview with Queen Mary
in order to torture her a little more about the
bogus conspiracy against Elizabeth's life. He
desired her to ask pardon of Elizabeth and
confess her fault. Mary's elastic spirit got the
better of her, and she said ironically that “his
proposal reminded her of what one would say
to children when one wanted them to confess.”
Paulet, who was destitute of humour, remained
silent as if struck dumb. His importunity to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Mary to “confess something,” as he put it, was a
trick to inveigle her, but it failed. This must
have been a great disappointment to Elizabeth,
for she had no evidence to prove her case.
Elizabeth nominated the commissioners for
Queen Mary's trial.</p>

<p>The commission was issued on 5th October to
forty-six persons, and included peers, privy
councillors, the Lord Chancellor, five judges,
and the Crown lawyers, constituting them a
court to inquire into and determine all offences
committed by the Scottish Queen against the
statute of the 27th year of Elizabeth. Shrewsbury
and ten others declined to serve on this
commission. The commissioners arrived at
Fotheringay on 11th October, and Bromley
and Burghley were appointed to conduct the
trial. Elizabeth could not take the life of the
Scottish Queen without the formality of a trial,
and she therefore made her arrangements for
an imposing function, so as to satisfy the public
mind that she was doing her duty and that
the trial was of the utmost importance, being
no less than to determine a conspiracy against
her own life and an invasion of England. In
an age when the people were grossly ignorant
and probably superstitious, a charge like this, on
its becoming publicly known, was bound to set the
people against the Scottish Queen.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>After the arrival of the commissioners we have
the solemn farce of “preaching and prayers” at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the chapel of Fotheringay, which Sir Walter
Mildmay and others attended as a prelude to the
trial. When we consider that these men came
there (<i>a</i>) to try an innocent person, (<i>b</i>) that they
had no proof, (<i>c</i>) that they had their Sovereign's
command to condemn her with or without proof,
this service was a mockery. It was not a
Catholic service, consequently Mary had nothing
to do with it. And in anticipation of what was
coming, we have Elizabeth's really first insolent
letter to Mary as referred to by Bourgoyne, in
which she addresses her as “Madam” and
appends simply her signature “Elizabeth.” No
one can realise how keenly Mary felt this insult,
while Bourgoyne passes it over as evidently too
painful to be recorded.</p>

<p>The impatience of the English Queen to have
the captive tried and executed is manifest from
the following paper, which conveys her instructions
on the subject. Burghley and Walsingham were
to use their discretion respecting the manner of
first communicating with Mary, in respect of
any private interview, if she should desire one,
and likewise as to the expediency of admitting
the public.</p>

<p>Commission from Queen Elizabeth to Lord
Burghley and Walsingham, 7th October 1586:—</p>

<p>“Whereas in the course of your proceedings at
Fotheringay it has not yet been considered what
form is to be kept by you and others of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
commissioners in acquainting the Scottish Queen
with our pleasure and the delivering of our letters
(a matter notwithstanding fit to have been
thought on), or whether to send some two or
three of the nobility and council to her to that
effect, or to commit the same only to the charge
of Sir Amias Paulet, in whose custody she
presently remaineth. We have thought good to
put you in mind thereof, and in case any scruple
arise expressly to authorise you to proceed as in
your judgment is most conformable to our honour
and service.</p>

<p>“It may be that she may desire to have private
conference with some of you, with whom she may
offer to deal more frankly than before the whole
number, wherein you may happen to make some
difficulty without special warrant and direction
from us. We authorise you, in case any such
request be made, and that you find it expedient
to make choice of two, three, or four of the
nobility and council there, besides yourself, to
repair privately to her to hear what she has to
say and deliver to you without prejudice, notwithstanding
that commission and warrant we have
already given for your guidance, and where also
we are informed that many private persons, as
well as strangers as of our own subjects (amongst
whom we hear are many ill-affected), are already
gone down to the place of your meeting, to observe
and hearken after the doings there.</p>
<p>“Forasmuch as under this cloak there may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
resort thither some bad and dangerous men,
whose conduct at such a time may penetrate to
the heart of our service, we think it should be well
considered whether it be expedient to have the
proceedings against her so public that every man
may hear, or such only as by the commissioners
shall be admitted; as also, whether in case she
desire to hear her servants, Nau, Curle, and
Parker, personally to testify those things they
have confessed against her, it shall be necessary
to have them there, or to proceed otherwise without
them, which points we have thought meet be
presented to you.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Queen Elizabeth to Lord Burghley and
Walsingham, 8th October 1586:—</p>

<p>“Whereas the Scottish Queen may probably
desire a conference with some of you our commissioners
during your abode at Fotheringay,
as yet you have not been authorised to assent by
any special directions from us, our pleasure is, in
case any such request be made, that you two with
other two, three, or four of our council there, do
resort to her to hear what she shall have to say to
you, and thereafter, if you find cause, to advise us.
And these our letters shall be to you, and the rest
of our council whom you shall think meet to join
you, sufficient warrant and discharge in this
behalf.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>The following is an important letter in judging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of the policy and conduct of Elizabeth. It was
written before the trial took place, and its date
would be between the 1st and 14th October:</p>

<p>“Upon the examination and trial of the cause, you
shall by verdict find the said Queen guilty of the
crime wherewith she standeth charged.”</p>

<p>These are momentous words. The trial at
Fotheringay was therefore a mockery of justice,
as Queen Mary's fate was sealed long before
by the irrevocable edict of the English Queen.
Lord Burghley and others of the commissioners,
Walsingham excepted, must have felt themselves
in a position of great difficulty and responsibility
in convicting the Scottish Queen contrary to the
general consensus of opinion, and without being
able to produce any <i>bonâ fide</i> proof. They, however,
could not help themselves. They must obey
the edict or take the consequences. This was
the greatest blunder the English Queen ever
committed, and this fact dawned upon her the
morning after Queen Mary's death. During the
remaining years of her life she was tortured day
by day by an evil conscience, and died a miserable
death:—</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Queen Elizabeth to Lord Burghley:</p>

<p>“Whereas by your letter received we find that
the Scottish Queen absolutely refuses to submit
herself to trial or make any answer to such things
as by you and the rest of our commissioners she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
is to be charged with; and that notwithstanding
you are determined to proceed to sentence against
her, according to our commission given you, we
have thought good to let you understand that
upon the examination and trial of the cause you
shall by verdict find the said Queen guilty of the
crimes wherewith she stands charged; and that
you accordingly proceed to the sentence against
her. Yet do we find it meet, and such is our
pleasure, that you nevertheless forbear the pronouncing
thereof until you have made your
personal return to our presence and reported to
us your proceedings and opinions, unless you find
it may prejudice your principal commission or
hinder our service to advise us and abide our
further answer. And this shall be to you and
the rest of the commissioners sufficient warrant
and discharge.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This is a letter that has not been sufficiently
brought to the front by historians of Queen
Mary. It practically settles the question of the
Babington Conspiracy, and stamps that plot, so far
as the life of Elizabeth is concerned, as a purely
bogus transaction. If the Queen of England
could have proved her case or identified the
Scottish Queen with it she would never have
written this letter. In the face of this communication,
which condemned Queen Mary before
she was heard, the conclusion is inevitable that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the Babington Conspiracy against Elizabeth was
a huge fraud, unknown to the Scottish Queen,
fabricated by Walsingham and Phillips, proclaimed
to the world in all sincerity by Lord Burghley,
and having its inspiration directly from the Queen
of England. In all this the character of Elizabeth
is quite intelligible, her ideas of the eternal
principles of justice such as no one can misapprehend,
while students of history must form
their own opinion, after perusing this letter, how
far she was responsible for the deliberate murder
of the Queen of Scots, whom she had tortured
nineteen years in captivity.</p>

<p>An important interview took place on 12th
October between Queen Mary and Sir Walter
Mildmay, Edward Barker, and Paulet, when they
delivered to her a letter from Elizabeth. The
object of the interview was to persuade Mary
to stand her trial. After she had read Elizabeth's
letter she said she was sorry that the English
Queen was so ill-disposed to her; that after so
many promises made on her behalf she found she
was neglected, and though she had forewarned
things dangerous to her and the State, she was
not believed but contemned. And the Act of
Parliament lately passed <i>gave her sufficient understanding
what was intended against her</i>.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the same day a second
interview took place, the deputation waiting to
know if she adhered to her former answers. She
asked them to be read over and she would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
consider them. That being done, she said they
were all right. She had omitted in the morning
to reply to Elizabeth's remark that “because she
(Mary) had enjoyed and was under the protection
of her laws, therefore she was subject to be tried
by them.” Her answer was that she came into
this realm for safety, and ever since had been
kept a prisoner, so that she enjoyed no protection
from the laws of this realm and no benefit
therefrom; neither was it lawful for her to take
notice of the laws from any man. This she
wished to add to her former answers.</p>

<p>The third interview took place the following
day, 13th October, when Bromley and Burghley
spoke with her. They said, in a very harsh
manner, that the statements of the two previous
interviews were insufficient; that neither her pretended
captivity nor her claim of privilege of
being born a queen could exempt her from
answering in this realm to such a crime as she
was charged with. They wanted a definite reply
whether she meant to continue in her refusal of
appearing before the commissioners to answer
the charge; and though they might justly proceed
to trial without her presence, or any further
notice of her, yet in honour, and because of
Elizabeth's good disposition to justice, they desired
her to alter her answer and to hear what should
be produced and proved against her. They
wished to convince her that in this manner of
proceeding nothing was offered or intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
against her but what was conform to the laws
of the realm and to justice. They required her
immediate answer, and gave her to understand
that if she refused the commissioners were to
proceed with the trial without further information.</p>

<p>To this arrogant speech the Queen replied
that she was no subject of the realm of England,
and would rather die than become one. She was
prepared to affirm on oath that she never did
evil to the Queen or the State of England, and
was not to be proceeded against, as she was no
criminal; therefore she adhered to her former
answer and protestation. She might answer before
a free Parliament, but she knew not <i>what obligation
or promises some of the commissioners had come
under before seeing her. She thought all their
procedure merely formal, as she believed she was
already condemned by those who should try her.</i></p>

<p>It is necessary to observe at this point that
Elizabeth wrote Burghley on 12th October that
as the Scottish Queen refuses to submit to be
tried, she requests that, “in case they proceed and
find her guilty, they are to defer passing sentence
until they return to her and report proceedings.”</p>

<p>The question naturally arises, how did Elizabeth
know on 12th October that Mary refused to
submit to be tried, when it was on that same day
that Mary made the announcement? The one
Queen was at Windsor, the other at Fotheringay,
and the transmission of letters at that period was
slow. Elizabeth did not and could not know on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the 12th October what happened at Fotheringay
on the same date; she could not but be aware
that the Scottish Queen would protest against
any such proposal as being tried, and the letter
to Burghley was simply a part of her policy to
have Mary executed notwithstanding any trial.</p>

<p>On the morning of 14th October the trial began,
when Bromley opened the proceedings charging
Mary with the Babington Conspiracy. The Queen,
notwithstanding the interview of the previous day,
defended herself with great eloquence. It was the
crowning effort of her life, in spite of the exertions
of Bromley and Burghley to crush her. In
asserting her innocence she “protested before
the living God that she loved the Queen of
England,” and in her concluding sentence she
“appealed to Almighty God, her Church, and all
Christian princes, and the Estates of the kingdom,
she was ready and prepared to sustain and defend
her honour as an innocent person.” She charged
Walsingham as being her enemy. Whether she
knew of his interpolations on her letters is not
clear, but she undoubtedly suspected him.</p>

<p>Walsingham's reply was significant and cunning:
“He bore no ill will to anyone; he had never
attempted anyone's life (yet he was plotting
against Queen Mary's life at the time he was
speaking), and protested that he was a gentleman,
and a faithful servant of his mistress.” No one
will doubt the last remark, and no one will believe
the words that go before. Mary had charged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
him with being in communication with Ballard, one
of the conspirators. If she had followed up this
line of argument she would have defeated her
accusers, but she was not allowed to produce a
single witness nor to refer to her letters, and
therefore could only say what she imperfectly
remembered.</p>

<p>Petit's version of the Walsingham incident
varies from this. She said, addressing him
haughtily, “Do you think, Master Secretary, that
I am not aware of the artifices you use against
me with such knavish cruelty? Your spies beset
me on all sides; but you perhaps do not know
that many of those spies have made false depositions,
and have warned me of what you are about.
And if he has so acted, my lords, how shall I be
assured that he has not forged my cyphers to put
me to death, when I know he has conspired
against my child's life and mine?”</p>

<p>Those withering words, falling suddenly and
without warning on the head of the guilty
Walsingham, called forth a quick reply: “God
is my witness,” exclaimed he, “that in private I
have done nothing but what an honest man
ought to have done, and in public I have done
nothing unworthy of my office. I have carefully
sifted the conspiracies against Elizabeth, and had
Ballard tendered me his services I should have
accepted them.”</p>

<p>Queen Mary: “Give no more heed to the
words of those who slander me than I do to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the statements of those who betray you. No
value is to be attached to the testimony of those
spies or agents whose words always give the lie
to their hearts. Do not believe that I have been
vain enough to wish that harm should be done
to Elizabeth. No; I shall never seek her ruin at
the cost of my honour, my conscience, or my salvation.
Your proceedings are unjust: passages are
taken from my letters, and their real meaning
twisted; the originals were taken from me;
neither the religion I profess nor my sacred
character as a queen respected. My lords, if
my personal feelings can make one sympathetic
chord vibrate in your bosoms, think of the royal
majesty insulted in my person; think of the
example which you set; think of your own Queen,
who was, like me, wrongly mixed up in a conspiracy.
I am accused of having written to
Christian princes in the interest of my freedom.
I confess I have done so, and I should do so
again. What human creature, O good God,
would not do the same to escape from a captivity
such as mine! You lay to my charge my letters
to Babington. Well, be it so, I deny them
not; <i>only show me a single word in them about
Elizabeth, and then I shall allow your right to
prosecute me</i>.”</p>

<p>That Mary was so persistently attacked and
importuned about this, first by Gorges, then by
Paulet, Bromley, and Burghley, without proof,
indicates pretty clearly:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That she was ignorant of the so-called
assassination plot.</p>

<p>2. That the interpolations on her letter to
Babington were the work of Walsingham.</p>

<p>3. That the importunity of Elizabeth's ministers
was by Elizabeth's express command, and was
part of a deliberate plan to incriminate Mary, in
order to justify her execution.</p>

<p>4. That this course was considered the most
politic in order to defend their action before the
crowned heads of Europe.</p>

<p>To the unlearned in those times a charge of
this kind instituted by the Queen of England
would, as already stated, be calculated to raise
great suspicions against the Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>There is some similarity between the murderers
of Darnley meeting solemnly at the Privy Council
and resolving to prosecute and punish the
murderers, and this trial at Fotheringay, when
Elizabeth, who was responsible for the conspiracy
against her own life, resolved to punish the
authors of that conspiracy. In view of this,
the speech of the Lord Chancellor in opening the
case is an extraordinary exhibition of the corrupt
morality of the period. The scheme to incriminate
Mary was not a secret one. Its
execution by Walsingham and others would
make it universally known at the English court.
Of the conduct of Elizabeth's ministers in this
matter there is only one explanation, and that
was their fear of death. They were presumably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
terrified by such a bloodthirsty woman, and were
glad to do anything rather than irritate her.
Mary told them that Babington's plot was simply
to release her, and she demanded to see any letter
of hers referring to a conspiracy against Elizabeth.
But no such letter could be produced; only copies,
and these interpolated.</p>

<p>It would appear from Bourgoyne that during
the trial the manner of the prosecutors was
“to keep reading or speaking, in order to persuade
the lords that she was guilty.” All this
was doubtless prearranged. When the Queen
returned to her chamber she said to Bourgoyne
that the trial put her in mind of that of Jesus
Christ. They did to her in her place as the
Jews did to Him: “Away with Him, crucify
Him.” She saw that she was practically condemned,
and that nothing could save her. She
appealed to Almighty God as the judge of her
innocence, and demanded a public trial. This
they refused, and this must be regarded as a proof
of the weakness of their case.</p>

<p>The trial at Fotheringay was private and
limited to Elizabeth's commissioners and a very
few others. Burghley at the close of the Queen's
speech tried to make a point against her by charging
her with wearing the arms of England. To
charge the captive queen with that when she had
been nineteen years in captivity was an inexcusable
and heartless proceeding, and shows how
little better he was than his mistress. In regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
to Nau and Curle, Queen Mary said she could
not answer for them what they had written about
this enterprise (conspiracy); that they had done
it of themselves without her knowledge. Nau
had been a traitor for about a year before this,
and there is no doubt that anything he said
against her, though void of truth, would be greedily
devoured by Elizabeth's ministers. Mary said
that she and Nau had many quarrels because
she would not give in to his ideas and would not
instruct him. He did her great harm, and to
save themselves they had accused her.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth gave sentence of death
Bourgoyne says there was great excitement in
Parliament over it. We do not doubt this, for
every member of Parliament outside of Elizabeth's
ministers could not but be impressed with Mary's
eloquent words and with her innocence, and with
Elizabeth's tyrannical conduct. The treatment of
Mary by her tormentors was still further illustrated.
All her last requests were refused by Paulet, and
eventually she was not allowed to write a letter
without showing it to him and allowing him to
read it. Had the Crown of Scotland ever reached
a lower depth?</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day of the trial,
15th October, Burghley appears to have written
the following letter to Davison, one of Elizabeth's
secretaries. As Davison would put the letter
before his mistress, and Burghley knew that,
that would account for the wording of it. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
letter is not creditable to Burghley. It was a
dish prepared to suit the palate of Elizabeth.
“I did so encounter her (Mary) with the reasons,
etc., as she had not the advantage she looked
for.” Why was Queen Mary there at all?</p>

<p>Burghley, from his position, could not but be
aware of the tampering with her letters; that he
could produce no authentic proof against her;
that before the trial he had Elizabeth's order to
condemn her; and this letter to Davison was
therefore a discreditable communication from the
first minister of the Crown:—“This Queen of
the Castle (Mary at Fotheringay) was content to
appear again before us in public to be heard,
but in truth not to be heard for her defence, for
she could say nothing but negatively that the
points of the letters that concerned the practice
against the Queen's person (Elizabeth) were
never by her written, nor of her knowledge; the
rest for invasion, for escaping by force, she would
neither deny nor affirm. But her intention was
by long, artificial speeches to move pity, to lay
all the blame on the Queen's Majesty, or rather on
the Privy Council, stating that all the troubles of
the past did ensue because of her reasonable
offers and our refusals; and in these her speeches
I did so encounter her with reasons out of my
knowledge and experience as she had not that
advantage she looked for; as I am sure the
auditory did find her case not pitiable, her
allegations untrue, by which means great debate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
fell yesternight very long, and this day renewed
with great vigour. And we find all persons in
the commission fully satisfied, as by Her Majesty's
order judgment will be given at our next meeting;
but the record will not be provided in five or
six days, and that was our reason why, if we
had proceeded to judgment, we should have
tarried five or six days more. And surely the
country could not bear it by the waste of bread,
specially our company being there, and within
six miles above two thousand horsemen, but by
reason of Her Majesty's letter we of her Privy
Council, that is, the Lord Chancellor, Mr. Rich,
the Secretary, and myself, only did procure this
prorogation for the other two causes.”</p>

<p>Mary was evidently not aware that, by an Act
passed fifteen years before, witnesses in trials
for high treason were required to be confronted
with the accused, and not one of her six-and-thirty
judges had the courage to inform her of
this important fact. All remained deaf to her
appeals; her secretaries were not examined and
her notes were not produced. Nothing could have
been more utterly worthless than the evidence
produced against her. The letters were alleged
to be copies of cyphers, but by whom the cyphers
were deciphered, and by whom the copies were
made, the commissioners were not informed, nor
did they ask a question on the subject.
<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>On the second day neither the attorney-general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
nor the solicitor-general nor the Queen's sergeant
took any part in the proceedings. Whether he
was dissatisfied with the mode in which they
had conducted the case, or whether he was
desirous of displaying his erudition and his
animosity against the Scottish Queen, Burghley
took upon himself the whole management of the
trial. Such conduct on the part of a judge was
neither dignified nor decent, nor do we find in
any other of the State trials of this reign so
marked a departure from established usage. It
may perhaps be taken as a proof of his declining
powers that he had even the vanity to boast of
the skill and success with which he had encountered
and defeated the “Queen of the
Castle,” as he facetiously termed the woman
against whose life and reputation he had plotted
incessantly for more than twenty years.
<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>On the 25th October the commissioners met in
the Star Chamber, Westminster. With one exception,
they found Mary guilty, not of the various
matters laid to her charge by Burghley, but
of having compassed and imagined since 1st June
divers matters “tending to the hurt, death, and
destruction of the Queen of England.” Lord
Zouch alone had the spirit to dissent from the
sentence, declaring that he was not satisfied that
she had done so. Thus ended the most disgraceful
of all the judicial iniquities which disgrace
the history of England. No witnesses were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
examined, and of the various documents produced
against her not one was original. They were not
even copies of written papers; they were only
alleged to be copies of cyphers, on the credit of
men who were not confronted with the accused,
and whose signatures attached to their alleged
confessions were either obtained through fear
of torture or forged by Phillips.
<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is evident
that the utmost exertions and the strictest search
on the part of Mary's enemies, directed by all
the skill and vigour of Walsingham and carried
into effect by the unscrupulous artifices and ingenuity
of Phillips, had not been able to find the
smallest scrap of evidence under Mary's hand
which could connect her with the plot against
Elizabeth's life. The whole case has been examined
and carefully weighed, and the result is a
confirmation of Mary's innocence.
<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>That devoted friend of the Queen of Scots,
Marie Seton, one of the four Maries, now living
in the convent of Rheims in France, had evidently
heard of the overwhelming calamity which had
befallen her old mistress, and writing a private
letter to Courcelles, the French Ambassador in
Scotland, sent by Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> to urge Queen
Mary's cause before Elizabeth, under date 21st
October 1586, said:—</p>

<p>“If she had not had a long experience of his
courtesy she would complain of lack of news, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
she only heard yesterday of his going to Scotland,
in a letter from Paris on the return of M.
d'Epinart's son. Begs to recall herself to his
memory. It is nearly twenty years since Marie
Seton left Scotland, and almost all her relatives
and friends had died during that period: still
there must be some who would let her know any
news that he might be kind enough to tell her.
She apologises for a short letter, but has to write
in great haste. She only adds that she is in great
trouble and anxiety over the news which the talk
in France has of fresh troubles to the Queen her
mistress, and commends M. de Courcelles to God,
praying to God that he may be happier than she
is,” etc.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>The espionage of the Scottish Queen continued
with unabated energy. Paulet was careful not to
name her in his correspondence with his august
mistress, but used the expression “this Queen.”
This pleased Elizabeth, and Paulet had her instructions
to report daily everything that passed
even to the minutest particular. The following
letter, Paulet to Walsingham, 24th October 1586,
enables us to understand the sort of material
Elizabeth desired and relished. This illiterate individual
instructing the Queen of Scots what books
to read is highly ludicrous. Mary's sarcasm would
doubtless be exercised on such a tempting opportunity,
but Paulet takes care not to record it:—</p>

<p>“I took occasion yesterday, accompanied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Stallenge, to visit this Queen, who hath been
troubled these two days past with a defluxion in
one of her shoulders. I see no change in her
from her former quietness and security certified in
my last letter, careful to have her chambers put in
good order, desirous to have divers things provided
for her own necessary use, expecting to
have her money shortly restored, taking pleasure in
trifling toys, and in the whole course of her speech
free from grief of mind to all outward appearance.
I tarried with her one hour and a half at the
least, which I did on purpose to feel her disposition,
and moving no new matter myself, suffered
her to go from subject to subject at her pleasure.
She had a long conversation with Lady Shrewsbury
of the Lord of Abergavenny, and of some other
things not worthy of notice. This only I thought
good to signify to you, that failing in the talk of
the late assembly here, and having glanced at
Lord Zouch for his speech in her chamber, and
also of Lord Morley for some things delivered
by him to the lords sitting next to him, which
she said she overheard and told him so in the
open assembly. She was curious to be informed
of the names of those sitting in such a place,
and of others sitting in other places, saying that
one had said little, another somewhat more, and
others very much. I told her that I might easily
perceive by her reference to the lords which she
had named that she was much inclined to think
ill of all of those who spoke, and that I would forbear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
to name any to her, praying her to think
honourably of the whole assembly, and to think
that those who spoke and the rest who were silent
were of one mind, to hear her cause with all impartiality.
She added that the histories made
mention that the realm was used to blood. I
answered that if she would peruse the Chronicles
of Scotland, France, Spain, and Italy, she would
find that this realm was far behind any other
Christian nation in shedding of blood, although
the same was often very necessary where dangerous
offences arose. She was not willing to go further
into this matter, and indeed it was easy to see
that she had no meaning in this speech to reach
her own cause, but spoke by way of observation,
after her usual manner. Thus you see that I am
bold to trouble you with trifles, as one willing to
be blamed rather for lack of good manners than
for want of diligence.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>It would appear that on 11th November
Walsingham received an anonymous letter, evidently
from a Catholic writer, informing him that
Elizabeth dared not put the Queen of Scots to
death for fear of the consequences. This threat,
however, was not followed by any movement to
support it. The indifference of the Scottish people
to the persecution and imprisonment of their
Sovereign cannot be explained unless their loyalty
to James <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, her son, stood in the way, and they
could not face a rebellion.</p>

in the previous chapter touched on the
various points which occupied the attention of
Queen Mary's enemies during the past four
months, we now arrive at a critical period, the
month of November. The situation was gradually
becoming more serious and more acute, indicating
that the mind of Elizabeth was not only
fixed on the Scottish Queen during the day but
during the night. The subject, in short, engrossed
her whole attention. On 16th November 1586
she formulated her final instructions to Lord Buckhurst
regarding the sentence of death which in
her former letter she had ordered her ministers to
find and pronounce. In this document, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
we give in full, much is false and conjectural,
much of it grotesque, while none of it is sincere
or truthful. It would not occur to the Queen
of England that these interpolations on Queen
Mary's letters would ever be discovered:—</p>

<p>“Instructions given by Elizabeth to Lord Buckhurst
and Robert Beale to declare to the Queen
of Scots the sentence passed against her and the
demand for her execution:</p>

<p>“After you have informed yourselves particularly
as well of the treatise offered and other things
needful which have passed between us and the
Scottish Queen; of the manifold favours we have
from time to time shown to her, both before and
since her arrival within our realm, requited by
her great ingratitude toward us, of which our
pleasure is you shall receive some special note
and remembrance from our principal secretary
Walsingham, as also of the whole course of our
proceedings with her in trial of the late unnatural
and wicked conspiracy against our life and Crown,
whereof she is found by a just and honourable
sentence of our nobility to have been not only
privy and consenting, but also a compasser and
contriver to the inevitable danger of our life and
state. God of his great mercy towards us and
our poor people most happily and miraculously
discovered and prevented the same. Our pleasure
is that you shall immediately repair to Fotheringay,
where the said Queen now remains in charge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Sir Amias Paulet, and after you have delivered
our letter to him and imparted our instructions
and other directions, you shall go together to the
Scottish Queen, to whom you shall signify the
cause of our sending you to her, namely, to let her
understand how the lords and our commissioners
lately sent to Fotheringay have proceeded from
their return from her. You shall particularly explain
the causes which moved them to postpone
the pronouncing of their sentence, their several
meetings after their return at our Star Chamber
to examine and perfect their proceedings, so that
no just exception might be taken against the
same; the producing before them of Nau and
Curle; their free, voluntary, and public maintaining
and confirming in their presence, without
either hope of reward or fear of punishment, of
all those things which they had before testified
both by word, subscription, and oath, against her;
and finally, the sentence given by the universal
consent of all the lords and other commissioners,
that she was not only privy to the late most
horrible and wicked conspiracy against our person,
but a contriver and compasser thereof according
to the words of the sentence, which to this effect
our pleasure is shall be delivered to you. And
also how the Parliament of this realm now
assembled, having been informed of our honourable
and just proceedings by our commission,
directed to the lords and others appointed for the
examination and trial thereof, and made acquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
with the particulars of those things with which
they found her charged, together with the
testimonies and proofs produced against her,
and her own answers to the same. Finding, after
deliberate consideration, that the sentence pronounced
by the commissioners was most just,
lawful, and honourable, have not only with full
consent and without scruple or contradiction
affirmed and approved the same, but also by
sundry deputies selected from both Houses of the
Lords and Commons and addressed to us in the
name of the realm, offered and presented their
humble and earnest petitions to us, both written
and oral, tending to the moving and persuading
of us by their strong and invincible arguments to
proceed to the finishing of the sentence by the
execution of her whom they find to be the seed
plot, chief and motive and author of all these
conspiracies which these many years past have
been hatched, intended, and attempted against our
person, Crown, and State, and do yet still threaten
the same. If we should not apply that remedy
which in honour, justice, and necessity appertaineth,
we should be guilty and inexcusable before God
and the whole world of all the miseries and
calamities that may ensue of our neglect or refusal
to agree to their humble petition, so greatly
affecting the safety of our person and preservation
of the State, of religion, and common weal of our
realm, none of which can in their opinion be
otherwise sufficiently provided for and assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
against such outward dangers than by a just
execution of her by whom and for whom they
have been, and are still likely to be, devised,
attempted, and followed out against us. And for
that we are pressed on all sides as well with
respect to honour, justice, surety, and necessity
as the unfortunate suit and petition of our Lords
and Commons, who still protest that they can find
no other way of assurance for our person, religion,
and State than by proceeding against her according
to justice. You shall therefore let her
understand that we know not how it shall please
God to incline and dispose our heart in this
matter, but we have thought meet in conscience
that she should be forewarned thereof, so that she
may the better bethink herself of her former
sins and offences both to God and to us, and
call on Him for grace to be truly penitent and
for her late unnatural and ungodly conspiracy
against our life. This crime is so much the
greater and more odious in the sight of God and
man in that she hath suborned and encouraged
some of our own subjects to be the actors and
doers of an act so foul and horrible against their
Sovereign and anointed prince her own near
kinswoman, and one that, however she may
account thereof in nature and duty for past
benefits, ought to have received a more charitable
measure at her hands if either the fear of God or
common humanity had prevailed anything with
her. And because she should have no reason to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
think herself hardly dealt with in the manner of
our proceedings against her, you shall let her know
how much the respect of her degree, calling, and
nearness in blood to ourselves hath moved us to
take the course we have done in sending her a
number of our chief and most ancient nobility to
examine and try her offence. We might have
proceeded otherwise by an ordinary course of law
without these respects and ceremonies if we had
not preferred our own honour to any other
particular affection of malice or revenge against
her, which you may truly say is such as if the
consequence of her offence reached no farther
than to ourselves as a private person. We
protest before God we could have been very well
contented to have freely remitted and pardoned
the same, if we might hereafter have lived
sufficiently cautioned and assured against the like,
a thing so much the more hopeless however she
might hereafter reform herself. The taking of
our life and subversion thereby of the present state
of religion and commonwealth is amongst her
factors and instruments abroad and at home now
held and approved in their bloody divinity, as
work meritorious and lawful before God and man.
And whereas in the opening of these particulars
she may happen, as in the late meeting of our
commissioners with her, to fall into some justification
of her former offers and demeanour towards
us, removing the cause of all these mischiefs from
herself and imputing the same to the hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
treatment she may pretend to have received at
our hands. We have thought meet, in case she
shall fall into any such argument, that you remind
her how much she is to blame to wrong us in honour
with her unjust and untrue assertions, considering
how much more graciously we have dealt with
her than she could with any judgment or reason
expect, if we had proportioned our favour with
her own demerits. You may take occasion to
point out to her those our deserts and benefits
with her many ingratitudes in recompense for
them, which is conform to a special note from
our secretary which shall be delivered to you.
Lastly, in case you shall find her desirous to
communicate with either of you apart under a
pretence of revealing any matter or secret of
weight to be delivered to us concerning either
ourselves or our service, we think it not amiss that
you conform yourselves to her desire, and thereby,
if you find cause, to advise us before your return,
which we leave to your discretion.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This is probably the most startling official
paper to be found during the period covered
by our narrative. It is pure fiction and was
written a month after Queen Mary's trial. The
first question that arises is this: Was Elizabeth
connected directly or indirectly with the interpolations
on these letters, and if so, to what extent?
She was much too clever a woman to commit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
anything to writing that would incriminate herself.
We have evidence that Walsingham, her secretary,
was the writer of them, and that he paid Phillips
to open the letters surreptitiously, copy them, and
on the copies introduce the interpolations. The
originals were evidently destroyed, for they were
never seen again.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Could anyone suppose that this momentous
proceeding was going on without the knowledge
of the English Queen? Such a supposition
would be impossible. Walsingham was a daily
visitor at court and Elizabeth's paid secretary.
It would have been as much as his life was worth
to negotiate this diabolical plot unknown to his
mistress, and particularly as every movement in
connection with the Queen of Scots had to be
communicated to her. It was a case where she
reserved to herself exclusively the privilege of
giving every order, with no intention whatever of
consulting her responsible ministers or her Privy
Council. In this particular matter they were
merely figureheads. Walsingham, therefore,
whose character we have already described, was
in this case nothing but a puppet in the hands of
a powerful and unscrupulous woman, stronger
than himself. If he had an audience of her
daily no correspondence between them would
be necessary. The spies employed were
Walsingham's servants. Their object was to
inveigle Mary into a crime that was punishable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
with death. Walsingham having failed to get
Babington's consent to Elizabeth's assassination,
and thereby compromise the Scottish Queen,
evidently resolved on the other alternative, and
manufactured the material which Phillips introduced
into the letters. The circumstantial
evidence is too strong to permit of Elizabeth's
escape from the responsibility. The actual extent
to which she was compromised we shall probably
never know, but it is a fair and reasonable
deduction from the correspondence, as now
disclosed, to say that she and Walsingham were
responsible for connecting Mary with the plot
against her life. There is no proof against Mary
that will stand investigation, and no proof at
all save forged and interpolated letters (see pp.
228-40). It was, in plain language, a cunning
plot by Elizabeth against Elizabeth to encompass
the Scottish Queen in a false conspiracy against
her life.</p>

  <div class="caption">SIR FRANCIS WALSINGHAM,<br />

</div>

<p>The foregoing paper containing instructions to
Buckhurst, the outcome of this plot, we shall
proceed to analyse. For audacity and unblushing
falsehood it is almost without precedent. It proceeds
on the assumption that the duplicity of the
writer would not be found out, and we have no
evidence that during her lifetime, or for long after,
it was found out. The first paragraph takes us
back to the beginning of Mary's captivity, and
considering the length of that captivity and the
treatment Mary experienced, the paragraph and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
its charges may be regarded as sheer imagination,
to which the innocence of Mary has given the lie.
The second paragraph requires Buckhurst to explain
the cause of his mission, the entire responsibility
of which Elizabeth put on the shoulders of
her lords and commissioners, who, she says, gave
sentence against Mary unanimously! This almost
takes away one's breath. The reader will take
note that the sentence was written out by Elizabeth,
handed by her to her ministers with a
command to make it their finding notwithstanding
Mary's guilt or innocence. No one dared to offer
a word against it, or in short to have any opinion
of his own; otherwise it might have cost him his
life. As regards Nau and Curie, their evidence
was obtained by the rack, and is of no value.
The third paragraph orders the execution, with
the hypocritical reasons which led to it, in all of
which the wish is father to the thought, and
plainly indicates the mind of Elizabeth. The
conspiracy trick was an excellent trump card for
such a woman to play against Mary, and by that
means get quit of a rival whom of all the women
in the world she knew to be superior to herself in
every accomplishment. No woman could frequent
the court of Elizabeth who was superior to her in
these respects. We have a proof of this in the
famous interview between her and Sir James
Melville in 1564, when Melville's ingenuity was
taxed to the uttermost to acknowledge Elizabeth's
accomplishments against his will. The fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
paragraph may be considered as perjury and
hypocrisy and a repetition of the unblushing falsehoods
already expressed. The fifth paragraph
doubtless was intended to convey to Mary some
idea of the saintly conduct of Elizabeth and the
wicked conduct of Mary, which reminds us of
the Pharisee in the Hebrew story. The commissioners
were to let her know “how much in
respect of her degree, calling, and nearness in blood
to us, have moved us to take the course we have
done in sending our chief nobility to try her case.”
Whether this sentimental and insulting message
was conveyed to Mary is not recorded, but the
probability is it was not. The sixth paragraph
is an “instruction” to the captive that as she has
no case she is not to abuse the plaintiff. If she
attempted to justify herself before the commissioners
she was to be told what was equivalent
to an insult: “how much she is to blame to wrong
us in honour with her unjust and untrue assertions.”
This was before any assertions were
made! Obviously the English Queen was not
endowed with the common feelings of humanity.
If we wished to get a side-light into her character
this paper would afford us as much information
as we require.</p>

<p>On the same day, 16th November, Queen Elizabeth
wrote Paulet, authorising him to allow the
commissioners an interview with Mary:—</p>


<p>“We have thought it convenient, for sundry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
reasons, to send Lord Buckhurst and Beale to acquaint
the Queen your charge, as well with the proceedings
of the commissioners since their departure
from Fotheringay, as with what hath been lately
done in Parliament concerning the commissioners'
proceedings. Our pleasure is that you permit them
to have access to the said Queen, hoping in God
that before they repair thither you will be restored
to that good state of health, so that you may be
able to assist and join them in the present service
committed to them. And in case the said Queen
shall desire to have any conference apart, upon
pretence to reveal some secret matter to be communicated
to us, either with Lord Buckhurst or
with any one of our servants, we are willing to
assent thereto if she shall request the same; otherwise
we could best like that you should be present
when any such remarks should be delivered.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>When Parliament ordained the sentence to be
carried out, Elizabeth was the more overjoyed
at it as she believed herself thereby cleared,
while she had accomplished her brutal purpose;
and she took care to hint that but for the love
of her people she could never have made up her
mind to sign the death-warrant of Mary Stuart!
She said, “I must tell you one thing, that by
the last Act of Parliament you have reduced me
to such straits and perplexities that I must resolve
upon the punishment of her who is a princess, so
nearly allied to me in blood, and whose practices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
against me have so deeply affected me with grief
and sorrow that I have willingly chosen to absent
myself from this Parliament lest I should increase
my trouble by hearing the matter mentioned, and
not out of fear of any danger or treacherous
attempts against me, as some think. But I will
now tell you a further secret (though it be not
usual with me to blab forth in other cases what I
know). It is not long since these eyes of mine
saw and read an oath wherein some bound themselves
to kill me within a month. Hereby I see
your danger in my person, which I will be very
careful to prevent and keep off.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The unabated energy shown in the espionage of
the Scottish Queen is evident from Paulet's letter
to Walsingham under date 21st November 1586:—</p>

<p>“My letter to Her Majesty enclosed herein will
be, I doubt not, imparted to you; and although it
pleaseth you to impute her intended liberality to
my servants and soldiers to the report of Stallenge,
yet I am persuaded that the same hath proceeded
of your favour towards me and mine; wherein
you have bound me very much, and indeed I
thank you for it as for a singular benefit. I do
not remember, and I think I may be bold to deny,
that I have at any time left this lady in her
passionate speeches. I have said to Stallenge,
and it is very true that in former times I have
observed this course: to have as little talk with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
her as I might. Lately, following your direction, I
have given her full scope to say what she would;
and yet at some times, finding no matter to come
from her worthy of notice, I have departed from
her, as otherwise she would never have left me;
and I am deceived if Lord Buckhurst will not
give the same testimony of her tediousness.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>At this crisis the conduct of James <span class="smcap">VI.</span> surprised
many of the friends of Mary. He was
indifferent about his mother, because he was
shaping his policy to succeed Elizabeth, and to
do so he must not quarrel with her. A judicious
and well-expressed letter on the subject was sent
by Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> of France to Courcelles, his Ambassador.
It was intended that this letter should be
put before James, which doubtless was done, but
for the reason stated was not acted upon. It is
believed he could have saved his mother's life,
but he was a selfish young man, and from all
reports indifferent to his mother's circumstances,
he never having seen her since he was an infant.
The letter from the French King is full of
sympathy, with every expression of anxiety for
the sad and pitiful condition of the unfortunate
Mary. It bears date, St. Germains, 21st
November 1586:—</p>

<p>“I have received your letter of 4th October
informing me of the conversation which passed
between you and the King of Scotland on your
expressing to him the sincere affection I bear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
him, by which he seems to have an earnest
desire to correspond with me entirely; but I
wish that letter had also informed me that he
were better disposed towards the Queen his
mother, and that he had the heart and the will
to do everything to assist her in her present
affliction, considering that the captivity in which
she has been unjustly held for eighteen years and
more might have induced him to listen to the
many proposals which have been made to him
for obtaining her liberty, which is naturally most
desirable to all men, but more particularly to those
who are born sovereigns and to command others,
who are more impatient of being thus detained
prisoners. He ought also to think that if the
Queen of England should follow the advice of
those who desire her to imbrue her hands in the
blood of his mother, it will be a great stain on his
reputation, inasmuch as it will be thought that
he has withheld the good offices which he ought
to render her with the Queen of England, which
might be sufficient to move her if he had employed
them as early and as warmly as natural
affection commanded. It is much to be feared that
in case of the death of his mother there may be
hereafter some scheme for acting the same violent
part towards him, to render his accession to the
throne of England more easily attainable by those
who have it in their power to secure it after the
Queen of England, and not only to deprive the
King of Scotland of the right that he may claim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to it, but render doubtful that which he has
to the crown of Scotland. I know not in what
state the affairs of my sister-in-law (Queen Mary)
may be when this reaches you, but I desire you
will endeavour to excite the King of Scotland by
these remonstrances and any others that can bear
on this subject, to take up the defence and protection
of his mother; and tell him in my name
that this is a thing for which he will be highly
praised by all other kings and sovereign princes,
and that he may be assured if he fails in this,
great blame will attach to him and perhaps great
injury ensue to himself.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>In the circumstances this was a noble letter,
but on James it was quite lost. He had been
repeatedly asked to befriend his mother, but we
have no evidence that he ever did so. With
him “the love of money was the root of all evil,”
for he was constantly in want of money. Elizabeth
aided him, and in fact controlled him; but
that was no reason for allowing his mother to
be murdered when he could have prevented it.
King Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> of France behaved to Queen
Mary as a brother and exerted himself more than
anyone else to save her. But what is to be said
of her son, on whom this eloquent letter of the
King of France was lost!</p>

<p>It is evident from the conduct of Elizabeth that
Mary's life could not have been saved except by
military force, and nothing should have prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
James from appealing to arms. The kings of
France and Spain would have given him the
necessary assistance. The more we know of
James the less do we feel enthusiasm for him.</p>

<p>On 23rd November 1586 sentence of death was
communicated to Queen Mary by Buckhurst, by
order of Elizabeth. It does not appear that
Mary was surprised by the announcement; it
would rather appear that for some time she had
been daily in expectation of it. To an ordinary
individual the intimation would have been overwhelming,
it would have crushed him to the
earth. Mary, however, was made of sterner
stuff. She had an overflow of spirits, which
during her captivity did her great service and
was a great factor in preventing her falling into
melancholy. It may be said that her brilliant
spirit never left her, but carried her through all
her troubles up to their final termination. On
the very day when she received this crushing
intimation she sat down and wrote a long and
beautiful letter to the Pope, a letter which His
Holiness could not read without emotion. She
also wrote to the Duke of Guise. These letters
have been preserved and are as follows (slightly
condensed):—</p>

<p>23rd November 1586, Fotheringay:</p>

<p>“Holy Father; And so it is that it has pleased
God by his divine providence to make an order
in his Church by which he has willed that under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
His Son Jesus Christ crucified all those who
should believe in Him and be baptized in name
of the Holy Trinity should acknowledge one
universal and Catholic Church....</p>

<p>“I have been unable to give due testimony to
your Holiness in consequence of my detention
in this captivity together with my long illness,
but now that it has pleased God to permit for
my sins and those of this unfortunate island that
I should be, after twenty years of captivity, shut
up in a close prison and at last condemned to die
by the Government and heretical Parliament of
this country: as it has been signified to me today
by Lord Buckhurst, Amias Paulet, my keeper,
one Sir Drew Drury, and a secretary named
Beale, in name of their Queen commanding me to
prepare to receive death, offering me one of their
bishops and a Dean for my consolation, a priest
whom I had having been by them long ago taken
from me and kept I know not where, in their
hands. I have considered it to be my first duty
to turn myself to God, and then with my hand
to signify all to your Holiness, that although I
cannot make you hear it before my death, at least
after it the cause of it may be manifest to you;
which is, the whole well sifted and considered, for
the subversion of their religion in this island
alleged by them to be by me designed and in my
favour attempted both by their own subjects
obedient to your laws, their declared enemies,
and by strangers, in particular the Catholic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
princes and my relations, who all maintain my
right to the crown of England, causing me to be
named as such in their prayers in the churches. I
leave to your Holiness to consider the consequences
of this opinion, supplicating you to cause
prayer to be offered for my poor soul; and of all
those who have died or shall die for the same and
the like opinions. And also in honour of God
to distribute of your alms, and instigate the kings
to do the same, to those who shall remain alive
from this shipwreck. My intention being to
confess, to do penance so far as is in me, and
receive my viaticum if I can obtain my chaplain
or other lawful minister to administer to me my
last sacrament, as in default of this with a contrite
and penitent heart I prostrate myself at the feet
of your Holiness, confessing myself to God and
to His saints a most unworthy sinner, and deserving
of eternal damnation, if it please not the good
God who died for sinners to receive me by His
infinite mercy to the number of poor sinners
penitent by His grace. Entreating you to accept
this my general submission and as a testimony
of my intention to fulfil the rest in the form
ordained and commanded by the Church and to
give me your general absolution....</p>
<p>“I entreat your Holiness to impetrate from the
most Christian King that my jointure may be
charged with the payment of my debts and the
wages of my poor desolate servants, and with an
annual obit for my soul and those of all my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
brethren deceased in this just quarrel; having had
no other private intention, as my poor servants
present at this my affliction will testify to you, and
how I have willingly offered my life in their
heretical assembly to maintain my religion,
Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman, and bring back
the devout of this island; protesting in this case
that I would willingly demit all title and dignity
of Queen, and do all service and duty to theirs, if
she would cease to persecute the Catholics, as I
protest that this is the object at which I have
aimed since I have been in this country, and have
no ambition or desire to reign or dispossess others
for my own sake, being by sickness and long
affliction so weakened that I have no more desire
to trouble myself in this world than with the
service of His Church and the gaining of the souls
of this island to God. For evidence of which at
my end I would not fail to prefer the public safety
to the private interest of flesh and blood, which
makes me beseech you, with a mortal regret for
the perdition of my poor child, after having by all
means endeavoured to retrieve him, being to him a
true father as St. John the Evangelist was to the
youth whom he recalled from the company of the
robbers, to take at last all the authority over him
which I can give you to constrain him, and to call
on the Catholic King to assist you in what relates
to temporal matters, and especially together to
endeavour to unite him by marriage. And if God
for my sins permits him to be obstinate, knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
no Christian prince at this time who exerts himself
so much for the faith, nor possesses such means
of assisting in the reduction of this island, as the
Catholic King to whom I am so much indebted,
he being the only one who has assisted me with
his money and advice in my necessities, under
your good pleasure I leave him all the rights or
interest which I can have in the government of
this kingdom. Should my son remain obstinately
out of the Church; whom if he can be brought
back I desire to be by him and my kinsmen of
Guise assisted, supported, and advised, enjoining
him by my last will to consider them after you as
fathers, and to ally himself by their advice and
consent and with one of these two houses, and if
it should please God I wish him worthy to be a
son of the Catholic King. You shall have the true
recital of the manner of my last struggle and all
the proceedings against me and by me, so that,
knowing the truth, the calumnies which the enemies
of the Church would fasten on me may be by you
refuted and the truth known.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>

<p>Queen Mary at the same time wrote to the
Duke of Guise, Fotheringay, 23rd Nov. 1586:—</p>

<p>“You whom I hold most dear in the world I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
bid you farewell, being on the point of being put
to death by an unjust judgment, such a one as
never any belonging to our race yet suffered,
much less one of my rank. But praise God, my
good cousin; for, situated as I have been, I was
useless to the world in the cause of God and his
Church; but I hope that my death will bear
witness of my constancy in the faith and my
readiness to die for the support and restoration
of the Catholic Church in this unfortunate island.
And though executioner never yet dipped his hand
in our blood, be not ashamed, my friend; for the
judgment of these heretics and enemies of the
Church, and who have no jurisdiction over me, a
free Queen, is profitable before God to the children
of His Church, which, had I not adhered to, this
stroke had been spared me. All those of our
house have been persecuted by this sect; witness
your good father, with whom I hope to be received
in mercy by the just Judge. I recommend then
to you all my poor servants, the discharge of my
debts, and the founding of some annual obit for
my soul; not at your expense, but to make such
solicitation and arrangements as shall be requisite
to fulfil my intentions, which you will be informed
of by my poor disconsolate servants, eye-witnesses
of this my last tragedy. May God prosper your
wife, children, brothers, and cousins, and all belonging
to them. May the blessing of God and that
which I should give to my own children be upon
yours, whom I commend to God not less sincerely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
than my own unfortunate and deluded son. You
will receive tokens (rings) from me to remind you
to have prayers said for the soul of your poor
cousin, destitute of all aid and counsel but that of
God, who gives me strength and courage to withstand
alone so many wolves howling after me; to
God be the glory! Believe in particular a person
who will give you in my name a ruby ring, for I
assure you upon my conscience that this person
will tell you the truth agreeably to my desire,
especially as to what concerns my poor servants
and the share of each. I have suffered much for
the last two years and upwards, but have not been
able to inform you of it for an important reason.
God be praised for all things, and may He give
you grace to persevere in the service of His Church
so long as you live, and may that honour never
depart from our race, that all of us may be ready
to shed our blood in the defence of the faith
regardless of all other worldly interests. For my
own part, I think myself born both on the father's
and mother's side to offer up my blood for it, and
have no intention to degenerate. May Jesus
crucified for us and all the holy martyrs render
us by their intercession worthy of the free-will
offering of our bodies for His glory. Thinking to
degrade me, they took down my canopy, and my
keeper afterwards came and offered to write to the
Queen, saying that this act had not been done by
her command but by the advice of some of her
council. I showed them on the canopy, in place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
of my coat of arms, the cross of my Saviour. You
will be informed of all that was said; they have

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span>
the same day on which Queen Mary wrote to
the Pope and to her uncle, the Duke of Guise, she
also wrote to her devoted friends Don Bernard
de Mendoza, the Spanish Ambassador, and the
Archbishop of Glasgow. These letters, which
we reproduce, were evidently written under deep
emotion, and must have caused inexpressible
grief to the friends who received them. There
seems no doubt that Mary was quite estranged
from her son for some time before her death.
He was entirely under the control and in receipt
of a pension from Elizabeth, which would account
for it. Mary felt his conduct acutely; and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
later than 21st May 1586 she wrote a private
letter to the Spanish Ambassador (also given),
in which her feelings on the subject are
remarkably and excitedly expressed, even to
the extent of handing her rights (if any) in the
Scottish crown to the King of Spain, if her
son continued in his present course of conduct.
Mary has been taken to task for this letter by
some of her enemies, who would make out, in
defending her execution, that she sold the
crown to the King of Spain. She wrote the
letter in trying circumstances. The offer was
simply to express how keenly she felt hurt by
the behaviour of her son. There was nothing
more in the letter than that. As a matter of fact,
Mary had no rights in the crown to give away, but
her enemies chose not to recognise this. We have
not attempted to condense the two letters referred
to—that to Mendoza and that to the Archbishop.
They form a very important chapter in the last
days of her life, and are letters that cannot be
overlooked in surveying her history. A deliberate
perusal of them will strengthen one's belief in the
forgery of the letters in the appendix of this
volume. The sentence we have put in italics
in the letter to the Archbishop is a convincing
proof of the Queen's innocence as regards the
conspiracy against Elizabeth's life. We must
remember that this was amongst the last letters
she ever wrote, and after she had received sentence
of death.</p>

<p>Queen Mary to Don Bernard de Mendoza,
23rd November 1586:—</p>

<p>“Having ever found you zealous in the cause
of God, and desirous of my welfare and deliverance
from captivity, I have always communicated
to you my intentions upon that subject, begging
you to make them known to the King my brother.
For this reason I now write to bid you a last
adieu, notwithstanding the little leisure I have,
being about to receive the stroke of death which
was announced to me on Saturday last, I do not
know when or in what manner; but at least you
may praise God for me that through His grace I
have had the heart to receive this unjust sentence
of heretics with resignation, on account of the
happiness which I esteem it to shed my blood at
the requisition of the enemies of His Church, who
do me the honour to say that it cannot be subverted
while I am alive, and also that their Queen
cannot reign in safety in the same predicament.
As for these two conditions I have accepted
without contradiction the high honour they confer
upon me as one most zealous for the Catholic
religion, for which I have publicly offered my life;
and as for the other, although I have never committed
either act or deed tending to take off her
who was on the throne, unless it be that they
make a crime of my right to the crown, which is
acknowledged by all Catholics, yet I would not
contradict them, leaving them to think as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
please. This annoyed them much, and they told
me that whatever I may say or do, it will not be
for the cause of religion that I shall die, but for
having endeavoured to murder their Queen. This
I denied as being utterly false, having never
attempted any such thing, and leaving it to God
and the Church to dispose of this island in what
relates to religion. The bearer of this has
promised to relate to you how rigorously I have
been treated by those here and how ill served by
others whom I did not expect to have shown so
great a fear of death in so just a quarrel. They
have not been able to draw anything from me but
that I am a Queen, free, Catholic, and obedient to
the Church, and that not being able to effect my
deliverance by fair means, I was compelled to seek
it by those which presented themselves. Nau
then confessed all; Curle has in a great measure
followed his example; so that everything turns
against me. I am threatened if I do not beg
pardon, but I say that 'As they had already
destined me to die, they may proceed with their
injustice, hoping that God will recompense me in
another world;' and out of spite because I will
speak, they came yesterday and took down my
canopy, saying that I was no more than a dead
woman and without any rank. They are at
present working in my hall, erecting the scaffold, I
suppose, whereon I am to perform the last act of
this tragedy. I die in a just cause, and am happy
in having made over my rights to the King your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
master. I have said that I consider him, should
my son not return into the bosom of the Church,
as being a prince most worthy to govern and
protect this island. I have written to the same
purpose to His Holiness, and I beg you to assure
him that I die in the determination which I have
communicated to you, and also another whom
you know, to be his dearest and most intimate
friend, and a fourth, and those above all others I
bequeath to the protection of the King, beseeching
him in God's name not to abandon them, and
entreating them to serve him in place of me. As
I cannot write to them, greet them in my name,
and pray to God all of you for my soul. I have
asked for a priest, but do not know if my request
will be granted. They have offered me one of
their bishops, but I positively refused him. You
may believe all that the bearer of this shall tell
you, and also those two poor girls who have been
immediately about my person. They will tell
you the truth, which I beg you to make public, as
I fear that a very different interpretation will be
given. Order a mass to be said for deliverance
and repose of my soul—you know the place I
mean—and let the churches in Spain remember
me in their prayers. You will receive from me
as a token of my remembrance a diamond which
I have held very dear, having been given to me
by the late Duke of Norfolk as a pledge of his
troth, and I have always worn it as such; keep it
for my sake. I do not know that I shall have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
leave to make a will. I have applied for it, but
they have all my money. Excuse what I write in
sorrow and trouble, not having anyone to help
me to make my rough drafts and to write for me.
If you cannot read my hand, the bearer will read
it for you, or my Ambassador. Among other
accusations, that of Crichton is one which I know
nothing of. I fear greatly that Nau and Pasquier
have hastened my death, having kept some
papers; and they are men who will turn on any
side for their own advantage. Once more, adieu.
I recommend to you my poor and henceforth
destitute servants, and pray for my soul. I
recommend to you the Bishop of Ross, who will
be wholly destitute?</p>

<p>Queen Mary to Mendoza, 21st May 1586:—</p>

<p>“I am in trouble as to what will be the course
of events this side. Charles Paget is instructed
by me to communicate some overtures on my
behalf, concerning which I beg you to inform him
without reserve what you think can be obtained
from the King your master. There is another
point connected with that which I have kept to write
to you alone, that you may send word from me to
your said lord the King without if possible anyone
having knowledge of it. It is that, considering
the very great obstinacy of my son in his heresy,
I have determined, that in case he does not
conform to the Catholic religion before my death—as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
I must tell you I have little hope of his doing
so so long as he stays in Scotland—I yield and
give up my right, by will at my decease, to this
crown, to the King your master, begging him by
means of this to quietly take beforehand under
his complete protection both the State and affairs
of this country, which for the clearing of my
conscience I do not think I can put into the hands
of a prince more zealous for our religion and
more capable in every respect of re-establishing
it this side, so as to be of great importance to the
rest of Christianity. Let this be kept secret, more
especially as if it came to be known it would
mean in France the loss of my dowry, and in
Scotland entire rupture with my son; in this
country my utter ruin and destruction?</p>

<p>Queen Mary to the Archbishop of Glasgow,
Fotheringay, 24th November 1586:—</p>

<p>“After having deferred for a long time on
account of the imminent danger of the undertaker,
at last I have consented to the proposition which
has often been made to me to escape. You will
hear what has happened from the doctor and
other servants, who till now are left to me, I know
not for how long, nor whether I can have leisure
to make my will. And having that, I do not
know if I shall have power, all my money and
papers having been taken away, and having
nobody to help me to write, although I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
asked to have my almoner, that being more
suitable if it could be done; but I have had no
answer. If that is refused, will you entreat His
Holiness, the most Christian King, the King of
Spain, the Duke of Lorraine, and other Christian
friends my relations, that my papers and money
be restored, also the furniture which has not been
distributed to my servants, in order that my
conscience may be relieved towards my poor
servants and creditors. You will find this language
strange if you have not been told by
Buckhurst, Amias Paulet, Drew Drury, and Beale,
that the Assembly of Estates has condemned me to
death, and they have declared it to me on the
part of their Queen, exhorting me to confess and
acknowledge my offences towards her. And in
order to incite me to die well and patiently and
to discharge my conscience, she proposed to send
me a bishop and Dean, saying that her people
have made constant requests for my death, considering
that I being still alive and her rival, as it
would appear by my having taken the name and
arms of her crown, and not willing to give them
up except on condition of being declared next
heir to the throne, she could not live secure in her
kingdom; also being called by the Catholics
their Sovereign, her life had been so often
attempted for this end, that so long as I live
her religion was not secure in her kingdom. I
thanked God and them for the honour they had
done me in considering me such a necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
instrument for re-establishment of religion in this
island, of which, although unworthy, I wished to
consider myself a very zealous defender. In
witness of which (as I had before protested) I
offered voluntarily to shed my blood in the
quarrel of the Catholic Church, and if the people
thought that my life would help the welfare and
peace of this island, I would not refuse to give it
as a reward for the twenty years they have kept
me prisoner. As to their bishops, I praise God
that without them I know well enough my offences
towards God and the Church, that I do not
approve of their errors, and wish to have no
communication with them. If it please them to
allow me a Catholic priest, I said I would accept
it willingly, even demanding it in the name of
Jesus Christ in order to satisfy my conscience
and participate in the holy sacraments on leaving
this world. They told me I had done well, but
do what I would I could not be either saint or
martyr, as I was to die for conspiring against their
Queen and for having wished to dispossess her.
I answered that I was not so presuming as to
aspire to these two honours, but whilst they had
power over my body by divine permission, not by
justice, I was a Sovereign Queen, as I had always
protested. Still they had not power over my
soul, nor could they prevent me from hoping that
by the mercy of God who died for me He will
accept from me my blood and my life, which
I offer Him for the welfare of His Church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Besides, neither here nor elsewhere would I wish
to rule over a worldly kingdom and thereby
lose the eternal kingdom. And I shall beg
of Him that the grief and other persecutions
of mind and body which I suffer may be set
against my sins. <i>But to have conspired, counselled,
or ordered Elizabeth's death, that I have never
done</i>; nor would I permit on my part that even
one single blow [one snap of the fingers is the
original] should be given her. Oh! said they,
you have counselled and permitted the English
to name you as their Sovereign, as appears by the
letters to Alan, and Doctors Lewis and others,
and this you have not contradicted; to which I
answered that I had taken nothing upon myself in
my letters, but hindering the doctors and ecclesiastics
from naming me at their pleasure was not my
province, being obedient to the Church, approving
what she decreed but not correcting her. And I
said the same in regard to His Holiness if, as they
declared, he made me be prayed for everywhere
under a title of which I was ignorant. In any case,
I wished to die and to obey the Church, but not
to murder anyone in order to possess his rights.
In all this I saw clearly the pursuit of Saul against
David, but I cannot escape like him by the window,
although from the shedding of my blood protectors
may arise for the sufferers in this general quarrel.
In short, the day before yesterday Paulet returned
with Drury much more modest than gracious, to
tell me that, having been warned to prepare myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to confess my fault towards the Queen, I had shown
no repentance nor feeling of my fault, and he had
therefore commanded that they should take away
my daïs in order to signify that I was a woman
who had died without any honour or dignity as
Queen. I answered that God had called me by
His grace to this dignity, and I had been anointed
and consecrated justly, and that from Him alone
I held it, to Him alone should I render it with my
soul; that I did not recognise their Queen as my
superior nor her council and heretical assembly as
my judges; that I should die Queen in spite of
them, and that they had no more power over me
than robbers at the corner of a wood had over the
most just prince or earthly judge, but I hoped that
God would show His justice after my death upon
this kingdom. The kings of this country had
often been murdered, and it would not be strange
for me to be amongst them and those of their
blood. King Richard had been treated thus in
order to take away his rights. After these proposals,
seeing that my servants would not lend
a hand, all refusing boldly, even the poor girls
crying aloud for vengeance upon him and his
company, he called seven or eight satellites and
destroyed the daïs, sat down and put on his hat,
and informed me there would be no more time for
exercise and pastime, and thereupon made them
take away a billiard-table. I said thank God I
have never used it since it was erected; I had
always plenty of other occupations. I assembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
yesterday my little troupe to repeat to them
my protestation in respect of religion and the
things they had laid to my charge, such as having
distributed the estates, and other lies. Also I
charged them all before God to tell you of all
my behaviour and that of the others in this
matter. I remit to Messieurs de Lorraine and
de Guise, and all our relatives, everything
necessary for the safety of my soul, the discharge
of my conscience, and reparation of my honour,
and that of those to whom I belong, which by
my death they will put under their feet, not
reproaching me alone but my cousin de Guise
and all his relations for having given money
for her death. I say, and it is true, that I know
nothing of it and believe nothing of it.... I
am content, and have always been, to give my
life for the safety of the souls of this island.
Adieu for the last time, and remember the
soul and honour of her who has been your
Queen, your mistress, and your friend, and if I
have had any offence against you I pardon it, and
beg of you and all my servants to pardon what I
may have done amiss, just or unjust, protesting
that I believe you guiltless in everything towards
me, but you specially, as the principal and oldest
of my servants. I feel myself obliged to recognise
your services if God allowed me to live
longer; failing that, I shall pray God to the end of
my life to recompense you instead of me. May
God be with you and with my servants whom I

leave as my children.—Your affectionate and good

<p>James Beton, Archbishop of Glasgow, Mary's
devoted friend, was resident in France during the
greater part of her captivity.</p>

<p>After the communication of the death-sentence
Queen Mary employed her time in arranging her
worldly affairs and in preparation for her removal.
That was a task that was difficult of accomplishment,
as she had estates in Scotland and in
France, the actual extent of which we have no
means of knowing, but we have reason to believe
that they were in each case large and not easily
handled. On account of the arrogant and
obstreperous conduct of the English Queen, we
have no assurance that any of Mary's final directions
were attended to. An illustration of this
conduct will serve our purpose, and this will best
be understood by the reproduction of the following
letter:—</p>

<p>Queen Mary to Elizabeth, November 1586:</p>

<p>“I thank God with all my heart that it has
pleased Him through you to put an end to
the troublesome pilgrimage of my life. I do
not ask that it may be prolonged, for I have
only had too much time to experience its bitterness.
I only ask your Majesty, for I cannot
expect any favour from those zealous ministers
who hold the highest rank in England. It is only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
from you, and not from any other, that I expect
the following favour:—<i>First</i>, I beg of you, as I
cannot hope for a burial in England according to
the Catholic rites practised by the ancient kings
your ancestors and mine, and as in Scotland they
have desecrated the ashes of my forefathers where
my enemies wish to tarnish my innocent blood,
that my body may be carried by my servants to
be buried in some holy ground, preferably in
France, where the bones of my honoured mother
the Queen repose; so that this poor body, which
has never had any peace since it was joined to
my soul, may find it at last when the two are
separated. <i>Second</i>, I beg your Majesty, because
of the fear that I have of the tyranny of those to
whom you have abandoned me, that I may not be
executed in a secret place, but in the sight of my
servants and others, who can witness my faith and
obedience towards the true Church, and defend the
end of my life and my last moments against the
false reports that my enemies would circulate.
<i>Third</i>, I require that my servants that have
served me with so much grief and so much fidelity
may freely retire where they will and enjoy the
pittance that my poverty has left them in my will.
I entreat of you, madam, by the blood of Jesus
Christ, by our relationship, by the memory of
Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, our common father, and by the title
of Queen which I bear to my death, that you will
not refuse such reasonable demands, and that you
will assure me by card from your own hand. Thereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
I die as I have lived, your affectionate sister
and prisoner,</p>

<p class="ar">
  <span class="smcap">Marie R.</span>”
</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>These humane requests were refused by Queen
Elizabeth, and though the statement seems incredible,
it is unfortunately too true. Such a
proceeding throws a shadow of distrust over the
entire conduct of Elizabeth towards Queen Mary.</p>

<p>The subject of the King and the release of his
mother evidently occupied a good deal of attention
immediately Mary's fate had been announced.
One of the many communications on the subject
was that of Robert Stewart to the Commendator
of Pittenweem dated from Linlithgow, 27th
November 1586:—</p>

<p>“I delivered your letter to His Majesty at
Falkland, which letter and proposition was well
received. He inquired the knowledge of the
credit specified in the letter, which I would not at
that time declare in respect that both the persons
whom it touched were then present, but I told His
Majesty that I had something to declare that concerned
his welfare, which I should do when it
pleased him. I attended several times, but could
not find an opportunity until the report from His
Majesty's mother came: how her Grace was
accused and convicted for the conspiracy against
the Queen of England. His opinion apparently
was 'that she had done worse evil, and far
beyond her honour and duty, and he could in no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
wise excuse her for that conspiracy.' He added,
'She is my mother, and I love her as well as any
man may do his natural mother, albeit I must hate
her actions deadly.' I discussed with him the
power to sit and judge her according to their
pleasure, as she, being a foreigner, was not subject
to their laws. He said, 'Who could control the
Queen of England's laws within her own country?'
There is nothing apparently to be here but shame
and ruin, except God help in time. It is concluded
that the Queen shall die, but never while the King
is living and at liberty. We look for nothing but
to hear of her execution. The greatest part of
the nobility lie out and is almost careless, looking
for comfort where there is none. We are all in
a miserable state; if there be any hope of help,
haste in time, for he is not a Scotsman, though
farthest in his relations with England, who would
not hazard his life to relieve the Queen and desire
the King to give them licence to that effect. The
King believes that they dare do nothing to her.
This is folly; if her release be not effected with
great haste, she will take some sudden sickness, as
ye will hear. Alas! my lord, we had some hopes
after that parting to have had better news, but
I perceive nothing but what your lordship knows.
I dare not write what I would; I would rather be
dead than aye dying. At her best what help is
the Queen to us; we shall come and seek it of you.
As for the noblemen you left last in the country,
they believe you are either dead or have altered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
your opinion; we work that we may win, and we
work well for it.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This letter is given as one of the few communications
that have been preserved as coming from
Scotland during this period. Whether the people
of Scotland were silent respecting the extraordinary
persecution of their Sovereign, or
whether their protests against Queen Mary's
treatment have not been recorded, it is impossible
now to say. Their protests are conspicuous by
their absence. By far the best remonstrance
with Elizabeth on Mary's behalf was made by
Bellievre and Chateauneuf, Ambassadors to
Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> At their interview we have a
graphic picture of Elizabeth and a side-light into
her cruel disposition. How she takes God's name
in vain, when she knows she is not telling the truth,
is a scandalous act and an act of perjury. At
that time Walsingham's interpolations would be
imperfectly known outside the court, and that
would very probably induce her to speak as she
did. “It was impossible to save her own life
and preserve that of the Scottish Queen.” The
narrative of this interview is one of the most
important papers we possess relating to the last
days of the Scottish Queen. It would appear
that the French Government sent over to
England Bellievre as an Ambassador extraordinary
with express orders to look after the
Queen of Scots. Chateauneuf wrote asking him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to hasten his journey in case the Queen of Scots
should be murdered before his arrival. An
audience was arranged with Elizabeth, and it
took place on Sunday, 25th November, Bellievre
being accompanied by Chateauneuf. Elizabeth
received them with extraordinary pomp. She
was seated upon her throne, the lords and officers
being assembled around her in order of rank,
forming altogether a brilliant spectacle. Bellievre
then made his speech. “The enemies of the Queen
of Scots,” said he, “spread a doleful report among
your people that the existence of the Queen is your
ruin, and that your two lives cannot go on together
in this same kingdom.... It seems as if the
authors of that statement wish to attribute all to
the counsel of men and leave nothing to God's
providence.... If some Catholic princes resolve
to attack your kingdom, it will not be to save the
Queen of Scots, but to uphold religion. Though
the Queen of Scots be taken away from this
world, the cause of war is not removed, but rather
the occasion for it increased and the pretext for
war made more specious than before, to avenge
an act so strange and so extraordinary committed
against all worldly laws, against a sovereign
princess, a Queen anointed and held sacred in
the Church of God. If you put the Queen of
Scots to death, as some advise you, her death
will arm your enemies with despair and with an
honest excuse for attempting against you all
that may lie in their power to avenge the outrage.”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
After showing Elizabeth that she ran a
great risk in using rigorous measures, he asked
her to ensure Mary's safety, in the name of the
Queen-mother, the King of France, and the
reigning Queen, in extremely tender and touching
terms. “Madam,” continued he, “you
can greatly oblige us all by the resolution it
may please you to take in the case of the noble
princess who has been our Queen, and your
Majesty is sure to earn our lasting thanks if,
instead of handing her over to the evils with
which she is threatened, you tender her a
generous treatment.” Elizabeth replied, “That
she much regretted that persons of their quality
should have been chosen to negotiate so thankless
an affair, but that her resolution was taken;
and that at a later period the patience she had
shown to the Queen of Scots would be appreciated,
and the justice of her conduct recognised;
and that, besides, she had been for some time
past aware of the stories which people took the
trouble to tell her, but that those noble examples
could not induce her to change her purpose. She
took leave of the Ambassadors, telling them that
she put her faith in God, and that with His grace,
poor woman as she was, she should overcome
her enemies.” Sentence against Queen Mary
was officially announced in London on 6th
December, and by command the bells were rung
for twenty-four hours without ceasing. This
command was from the Queen of England, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
need surprise no one after the proceedings
we have narrated. Fires were kindled under
the windows of the French Embassy amid the
hootings of the mob. That affront roused the
indignation of Bellievre. He asked Elizabeth
to give him time to inform the King of France
what was going on. She refused to receive the
letter, and sent it to Walsingham. Three days
later Bellievre received verbally the assurance
that Mary would get a respite of twelve days.
Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>, on being informed, empowered Bellievre
to try all means which prudence might suggest
to bring Elizabeth to sentiments more befitting
humanity. Bellievre requested another interview,
which was granted. He then put forward the
wishes of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> regarding Mary, and his
grief on learning that the Queen of England
was so unkind to her illustrious prisoner. He
denied that Mary was under the jurisdiction of
Elizabeth, and reflected on the unseemly way in
which she had been treated. This noble princess
“is so humbled and trodden underfoot that her
greatest enemies ought to pity her, and therefore
I plead for some clemency and kindness
towards her at your Majesty's hands. What
now remains for the Queen of Scots but a
wretched life of a few short days! If she is
innocent, she ought to be discharged. If you
hold her guilty, it would be honourable and
noble in you to pardon her. When your Majesty
does so, then shall you do what princes are wont to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
do.... Those who wish to reign well and happily
had better imprint on the table of their memory
the sacred words, 'Thou shalt not kill.' Blood
calls for blood, and such doings often bring about
a sad end.” These eloquent words had no effect,
and he then addressed threatening words, which
aroused her. “Monsieur Bellievre,” cried she
angrily, “are you charged by the King my
brother to address me thus?” “Yes, madam,
I have His Majesty's express commands to that
effect.” “Have you that power signed by his
hand?” “Yes, madam; the King my master
has expressly commanded me and charged me
by letter, signed by his own hand, to address to
you remonstrances.” “I ask from you as much
signed by your hand,” added she. Bellievre
handed it to her at once, and immediately retired.
He then prepared for his return to France, taking
home with him only disgust at the course of
events, and bitterly regretting that he had not
been able to save the Queen of Scots.

</div>

<p>In the following condensed narrative,
<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which
is an extract from the official despatch of
Bellievre to Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>, we get the words of
Elizabeth in brief, at both interviews:—“She
burst into invectives against the Queen of Scots,
recounting the evil that she had received from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and the good offices she had rendered her; that
she had been compelled to come to the resolution
that had been taken because it was impossible
to save her own life and preserve that of the
Scottish Queen; and that if we knew any means
whereby she could find security for herself in
preserving the Queen of Scots, she would be
under great obligations to us, never having shed
so many tears at the death of her father, of her
brother King Edward, and of her sister Mary,
as she had done over this unfortunate affair.
The day before this audience Lord Buckhurst
was sent to Fotheringay to announce the sentence
of death to the Scottish Queen, and it has been
said many times in London (though falsely) that
they had already put the Queen to death....
Elizabeth gave another audience on the appointed
day, Monday. We repeated the same prayer
with all the urgency possible, and spoke in such
a manner that we could not be heard except by
her principal counsellors. But she rejoined in
so loud a tone that we were put in pain because
we were using prayer (as necessity required), and
by her answer we could not but understand that
our plaint was refused. Then lowering her voice
she told us that she would wish us to be well
advised, desiring the good of your Majesty, and
that you could not do better than give shortly
a good peace to your subjects, otherwise she
could foresee great injury to your realm, which
a great number of foreigners would enter in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
sort that it would not be very easy to find a
remedy for the evil. She returned to the
subject of the Queen of Scots, saying that 'she
had given us several days to consider of some
means whereby she could preserve that princess's
life without being in danger of losing her own;
and not being yet satisfied on that point, nor
having found any other expedient, she could not
be cruel against herself; and that your Majesty
ought not to consider it just that she, who is
innocent, should die, and that the Queen of
Scots, who is guilty, should be saved.' Two
day afterwards Elizabeth informed us, after a
long discussion, the reason which had moved
them to proceed to this judgment, that 'out of
the respect she had for your Majesty she would
grant a delay of twelve days before proceeding
to the execution of the sentence, conditionally
that nothing in the interim should be attempted
against her which might move her to alter her
mind.' We informed her that if she put to
death the Queen of Scots the King her son
was determined to renounce all friendship and
alliance that he had with England and to advise
with his friends how he shall proceed in her
cause; at which she put herself into a great fury.
Your Majesty will be pleased to consider if there
be not some way through your favour and authority
whereby there may be a hope of saving her
life, of which may it please you to let us understand
within the said term your goodwill and pleasure.”</p>

<p>This despatch is worthy of the admiration
of posterity, and may be regarded as the
production of one who was not only a highly
capable Ambassador, but probably of all the
men who aided Mary in her last hours he
was the most influential, the most determined
and earnest, and the most courageous. Who
was there of all Mary's friends and supporters
who could attack single-handed the lioness in
her den as he did? His brilliant interview, the
irresistible force of his eloquence, his contemptuous
disregard of her royalty, his plain
speaking, and his remonstrating with her as to
her unlawful and cruel treatment of Mary, roused
the ire of Elizabeth into a pitch of hysterical
excitement, and her screaming interrogatives
to the Ambassador were heard over the entire
body of the hall. The flashes of wit and ready
resources of Bellievre shown in his sarcastic
replies were characteristic of the vivid intellect
of a French statesman.</p>

<p>Bellievre's last communication to Queen Mary,
London, 14th December 1586:—</p>

<p>“As it has pleased the King to send me here
to inform the Queen of England how greatly
obliged he would be if, in this unfortunate matter
which has happened to your Majesty, it might be
her good pleasure to treat you with that kindness
and humanity that he, his kingdom, and the other
princes and States of Christendom would expect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
from so wise and virtuous a princess, I have set
aside everything in order to obey his commands
and to do the service that I wish to do to your
Majesty, whom I have so long venerated, as the
wife of my King, and as my Queen. I should
desire above everything in the world that it had
pleased God that this princess to whom I had
spoken on your behalf would have honoured me
with a satisfactory answer. I assure you, madam,
of the very good and cordial will of the King
towards you, of the Queen, her mother and yours,
and of the reigning Queen, who all suffer extreme
pain on your account; while they have written
to the Queen of England with as much affection
as if it were a question of their own lives. I
should hope that this princess, being so wise, so
magnanimous, and so well advised, would not
allow the prayers of persons so great and so
interested in your preservation to be made in
vain. Nothing is done in this world without the
permission of God, whose anger we cannot better
appease than by the exercise of a holy and
Christian patience. God permits us to be
abandoned by all men when for our greater good
He desires that we may have all our succour from
Him. 'When we know not what to do,' says
St. Bernard, 'to whom should we turn if it is
not to thee, O our God!' He is not willing that
we should be lost, and is able to give us in the
future more consolation in one hour than the
afflictions we have experienced during our whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
life. If you think the Queen of England has not
loved you, who knows that from this time it may
please God to soften her heart towards you? ...
It will be by God's grace that her good nature
will soften her. It will be her generosity that
will conquer and force her to love you, to take
you under her protection, and join herself to you
by the indissoluble ties of a good, happy, and
perpetual friendship.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">During</span>
the six months over which our narrative
extends, probably the most imposing document
that was issued was the proclamation by the Queen
of England announcing the sentence of Queen
Mary. This remarkable paper was drawn up
with consummate ingenuity, and no doubt represented
the combined skill of Elizabeth, Burghley,
and Walsingham. It is founded ostensibly on
the so-called Babington Conspiracy. In the full
knowledge of that plot which these three persons
possessed, and in the circumstances as now
disclosed, the issue of this proclamation was an
audacious and an unwarrantable act, and cannot
be defended. The document may be summed
up in one word, “infamous.” No one can blame
the Scottish Queen for encouraging every plot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
formed for her release from the miserable life
she was compelled to lead for the long period
of nineteen years. Not one of these plots, to
her knowledge, had anything to do with Elizabeth,
and up to the day of her death she repudiated the
charge that she ever did anything against Elizabeth's
life. When this denial was so repeatedly
given, Elizabeth's duty was to produce proof in
support of the charge, or, failing that, to release
the Queen. She neither did the one nor the
other. Nothing was ever produced but these
notable “interpolations.” Notwithstanding these,
she kept nagging and torturing the Scottish Queen
to confess her guilt; and when that failed she
executed her. During the captivity of Mary
many plots were formulated for her release,
principally by the Catholic party or individual
members of that party, all of which are not
recorded. It is natural to suppose that the
patience of the Catholics was exhausted at the
conduct of Elizabeth. Who could blame them
if they got up a rebellion or an invasion of
England by the aid of France and Spain to
compel Queen Mary's release? And who could
blame Savage and Ballard, two noted Catholics,
if they said they would themselves assassinate
Elizabeth, in order to release Mary? There
might be reasons for assassinating Elizabeth;
there were none for assassinating Mary. When
we further consider this proclamation of the
Queen of England, that it is full of misstatements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
from beginning to end; when we also consider the
mock trial of the Scottish Queen, and the sentence
made up and delivered to Burghley, by royal
command, before any trial took place, we shall
be surprised if any student of Scottish history
will fail to see that the Queen of England was
herself the prime mover in the matter for which
she executed the Queen of Scots. We now
reproduce this document, which must at the time
have greatly surprised and shocked the English
people:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, by the Grace of God, Queen of
England, France, and Ireland, defender of the
Faith, etc.: <span class="smcap">Whereas</span> we were given to understand
very credibly (though to our great grief)
that divers things were, and of late had been
compassed, imagined, and resolutely intended,
tending directly to the hurt and destruction of
our royal person, and to the subversion of the
estate of our realm by foreign invasions and
rebellions at home, as well by the Queen of Scots
remaining in our realm under our protection, as
by many divers other wicked persons with her
privity, who had freely confessed the same, and
had thereupon received open trial, judgment, and
execution according to law for their deserts.
And though in very truth we were greatly and
deeply grieved to think or imagine that any such
unnatural and monstrous acts should be either
devised or willingly assented to against us, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
her being a princess born, and of our sex and
blood, and one also whose life and honour we
had many times before saved and preserved.
Yet were we so directly drawn to think the same
to be true by the sight and understanding of such
proofs as were produced before us upon matters
that had proceeded from herself, as well as from
the conspirators themselves, who voluntarily and
freely confessed their doings jointly with her,
and directed by her, against our person and
realm. Therefore we saw great reason to think
the same too dangerous to be suffered to pass
onward to take their full effect. Wherefore we
were by sundry of our nobility, and others our
loving subjects, earnestly moved and counselled
to take order for the investigation and examination
of these dangerous enterprises and conspiracies
avowed to be by the said Queen of Scots against
us and our realm; and also to use all present
means with expedition, to withstand and prevent
the same. We were very unwilling to
proceed against her, considering her birth and
estate, by such means as by the common
laws of the realm we might have lawfully done,
which was by indictment and arraignment before
ordinary juries; therefore in respect both of our
own honour and of her person we yielded by
advice, to proceed in the most honourable way
that could be devised for the examination,
according to a late Act of Parliament made
23rd November in the 27th year of our reign.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Whereupon by our commission under the Great
Seal of England, bearing date Windsor, 6th
October last, we did according to the said statute
assign, name, and appoint the lords and others of
our Privy Council, and so many other earls and
barons, lords of Parliament, of the greatest degree
and most ancient of the nobility, as with the lords
and others of the Privy Council made the number
forty-two, adding also a further number according
to the tenor of the aforesaid Act of Parliament, of
certain of the chief and other principal judges of
the courts of Record, Westminster, amounting in
the whole to forty-seven, to examine all things
compassed and imagined, tending to the hurt of
our royal person as well by the Queen of Scots,
by the name of Marie, the daughter and heir of
James <span class="smcap">V.</span>, late King of Scots, commonly called
the Queen of Scots and Dowager of France, as
by any other by her privity, and all the circumstances
thereof, and according to the tenor of
the said Act of Parliament to give sentence or
judgment as upon good proof the matter to them
should appear. Afterwards the greater part of
these councillors, lords, and judges—that is to say,
the number of thirty-six—did in the presence and
hearing of the Queen of Scots at Fotheringay, at
divers days and times in public place, very
exactly, uprightly, and with great deliberation,
examine all the matters and offences whereof she
was accused, and all the circumstances thereof,
and heard also what the same Queen did or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
could say for her defence. Afterwards on the
25th October last, all the said council, lords,
and judges who had heard and examined the
cause in the said Queen's presence, with one
assent and consent, after deliberation, did give
their sentence in manner following:—That after
the first day of June in the 27th year of
our reign and before the date of the said
commission, divers things were compassed and
imagined within this realm by Anthony Babington
and others with the knowledge of the Scottish
Queen, she pretending a title to the crown of our
realm, tending to the hurt, death, and destruction
of our royal person; which sentence the same
lords and commissioners had caused to be put in
writing and duly engrossed, with the whole process
of their proceedings, and have subscribed the
same as by a record thereof shown to us. And
whereas the same sentence so given and recorded,
the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament
assembled have also at sundry times heard and
considered the principal evidence, proofs, and circumstances
whereupon the sentence was founded,
and have by their assent in Parliament affirmed
the same to be a full, lawful, and true sentence,
and so have allowed and approved the same in
writing presented to us. They have also notified
to us how deeply they did foresee the great and
imminent dangers which otherwise might and
would grow to our person and to the whole realm
if this sentence were not fully executed. Therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
they did by their humble petitions most
instantly upon their knees, pray, beseech, and
with many reasons of great force and importance
move and press us that the said sentence so
justly given and approved might, according to
the express tenor of the said Act of Parliament by
our proclamation under the Great Seal, be declared
and published and finally executed. But after such
request made to us by the Lords and Commons
in Parliament, they perceiving by our own speeches
and answers how deeply we were grieved to hear
of these horrible and unnatural attempts of that
Queen whose many former offences, manifestly
and dangerously committed against us, our crown
and realm, we had overlooked with our over great
clemency, contrary to the advice and request of
our subjects in Parliament and otherwise. Therefore
they also, understanding from us how desirous
we were to have some other means devised by
them to withstand these mischiefs intended against
us and the quiet state of the realm, and surety of
our good subjects, than by execution of the
aforesaid sentence as was required: they did
after sundry consultations jointly with one accord,
in the names of the Lords of Parliament, even by
the particular votes of those assembled, and also
of the Commons with one universal consent, representing
the state of the realm, allege, declare,
and protest, that upon their long and advised
consultations by our commandment and for our
satisfaction, they could not by any means find or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
devise how the surety of our royal person and
the preservation of themselves and their posterity,
with the good state of the realm, might be
provided for without the publication and due
execution of the sentence. Whereupon, being
not only moved by our grief, but also overcome
with the earnest requests, declarations, and
important reasons of all our said subjects, the
nobles and Commons, whose judgment, knowledge,
and natural care of us and the whole realm we
know doth far surmount all others being not
so interested therein; and perceiving also the
sentence to have been honourably, lawfully, and
justly given conform to justice and the laws of
the realm, we did yield, and do according to the
said statute by this our proclamation under the
Great Seal of England, declare, notify, and publish
to all our subjects and other persons whatever
that the said sentence is given in manner aforesaid
to the intent that they and every one of them by
this proclamation may have full understanding
thereof. We do also instruct you that you record
this our proclamation in our Court of Chancery as
speedily as possible; find place and time for the
proclaiming thereof; whereof fail you not. We
have caused this proclamation to be made patent
and sealed with the Great Seal of England.</p>

<p>At our Manor of Richmond, the fourth day of
December, the 29th year of our reign, and in the
year of our Lord God 1586.</p>

<p>

</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Following on the issue of this proclamation
Elizabeth wrote the following letter to Paulet,
which, taken in consideration with all the letters
she wrote to that individual, is probably the best
of them all for rank hypocrisy. A letter such as
this is beyond words to criticise:—</p>

<p>Elizabeth to Paulet, 10th December 1586:</p>

<p>“Whereas you have had and still have the
custody of the Queen of Scots, against whom
judgment has been given whereby she hath been
judged to have attempted our death and divers
things to the hurt, death, and destruction of our
person, as by our late proclamation of 4th
December has been published. We have been
continually by the states of Parliament moved,
urged, and pressed to cause further execution to
be made of the sentence, as without that it is
solemnly protested that they can by no device
find means for the surety of our person, the
preservation of themselves, their posterity, and
the realm. Whereupon we are, against our own
natural disposition, drawn to yield thereto; and
therefore we have directed our commission under
the Great Seal to the sheriff of the county of
Northampton to repair to you and receive the
person of the said Queen into his charge, and
without delay do execution upon her as by our
commission may appear to you. Therefore we
command you to deliver her into his charge, so
that he without delay shall in the presence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
sundry noblemen and yourself, within our castle
(Fotheringay) do the execution, and that you aid
and assist the sheriff and others who shall be
there for that service.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>After the issue of the proclamation and of this
letter to Paulet we have still some characteristic
documents to produce in connection with this
great event in Scottish history. We do not
think the public are aware that the speeches of
the Earls of Shrewsbury and Kent at the execution
were prepared several weeks in advance by
Elizabeth and her ministers. This appears from
a paper published by the Historical MSS. Commission
entitled, “Memorial from Walsingham
respecting the execution of the Queen of Scots,”
and its purport to consider what speeches were
fit for the two earls to use at the time of the
execution (noted in margin by Burghley), to
express her many attempts both for destruction
of the Queen's person (Elizabeth) and the invasion
of the realm; that the hope and comforts she
hath given to the prince Palatine, traitors of
this realm, both at home and abroad, are the
occasion of all the attempts that have been made
against Her Majesty's person. By the laws of
God and man she is justly condemned to die;
the whole realm hath oftentimes vehemently
required that justice might be done, which Her
Majesty cannot longer delay. To appoint only
the Scottish Queen's chief officers and servants to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
assist at the execution, excluding the women; to
direct the earls what to do in case she shall
desire any private speech (noted by Burghley);
<i>not to refuse it, so it be to three or two at the least</i>;
some special person to be appointed to take note
of her speech. The body to be buried in the
night in the parish church in such uppermost
place as the two earls shall think fit. Whether
not meet to be embalmed? To take order that
her jewels and plate may not be embezzled by
her servants. The lords at the court to give out
that <i>there will be no execution</i>.</p>

<p>The last sentence of this paper is very mysterious
and quite inconsistent with the proclamation
of 4th December; unless it be that that proclamation
was not published at Fotheringay for fear of
creating a panic. In that event the people would
have probably rescued the Queen, and there can
be no doubt that Elizabeth had this eventuality
before her and provided for it. She knew she
had taken up a very critical position. The execution
of so high a personage as the Scottish Queen
was an astounding event; and, like all tyrannical
rulers, she was in terror lest by some accident the
scheme would be overturned. It was therefore
in her opinion essential that the deed should be
accomplished with all possible privacy and all
possible speed. It has further to be noticed that
in connection with the order for “no execution”
there was issued what was called the “Hue and
Cry,” sent out on the pretence that the Scottish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Queen had fled from Fotheringay. This was
done conform to the following order from
Elizabeth:—“These are to charge you in the
Queen's name that you make 'Hue and Cry'
forward with all speed, and that you appoint,
watch, and keep watch in the Queen's highway
and at suspect places, and that you suffer none
to pass without examination, and that you make
'Hues and Crys' and send them forth with all
speed to every highway; for Fotheringay Castle
is broke, and traitors are fled out.”</p>

<p>The publication of the “Hue and Cry” in
these days was a common mode of warning the
people of any important event, and the official
order to issue this notice shows that the Queen
of England took the utmost precautions to make
the people in the provinces believe that there
was no execution taking place at Fotheringay. If
Elizabeth's conduct had been just and lawful, and
her sentence against the Scottish Queen conform
to the principles of justice, no such precautions
were necessary. Queen Mary, fourteen days
after the issue of this proclamation, wrote her last
letter to the English Queen (see Bourgoyne's
<i>Journal</i>, pp. 250-55). This communication is the
cleverest of all her letters to Elizabeth. If she
had adopted this style of composition when her
captivity began it might have been better for all
parties and led to different results. If Elizabeth
had any feelings at all, this letter, with its dignified
eloquence and its bitter reproaches, must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
touched her to the quick. Elizabeth's refusal to
grant any of Mary's last requests, even the place
of interment of her remains, was an act which has
rendered her name infamous to posterity.</p>

<p>Next in order in connection with these proceedings
we have a paper on the execution of Mary
said to be by Lord Burghley:—</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding that the Scottish Queen had
oftentimes sought the destruction of Elizabeth,
and has now been by order of justice convicted
and found guilty of attempting her death by
certain murderers, and that for the same she
deserved death, and so by the states of Parliament
adjudged; and requests being importunately made
to Her Majesty that for the avoiding of danger
to herself and the whole realm she might be
executed: Her Majesty, always inclined to mercy,
was most unwilling to assent thereto, as appeared
by her answers to Parliament, much to the
comfort of all evil-disposed persons whose estates
depended on the Scottish Queen's life and well-doing
in the hope of her coming to this crown
by depriving the Queen's Majesty of her life, a
life subject to daily peril so long as the Queen
of Scots is not executed. Her Majesty was
continually solicited by all who saw her perils and
understood how much her enemies at home and
abroad were comforted and inspired with hope
of the Scottish Queen's life and her treasonable
attempts against Her Majesty's life. Herewith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
followed the vehement solicitations by Ambassadors
out of France and Scotland to save
the Scottish Queen, without any stipulation how
the Queen's Majesty's life might be safe from the
attempts and treasons of many of them in England
and abroad. For preserving the Scottish
Queen to be Queen of this realm, they would
never desist from attempts against Elizabeth's
person. These Ambassadors were vehemently
handled, in promoting her foul acts intended for
killing Her Majesty, and for invasion and alteration
of the whole state of the realm. There was
also discovered a practice between the French
Ambassador and a lewd young miscontented
person named William Stafford, and one Maude,
a prisoner in Newgate, a mischievous, resolute
person, how Her Majesty's life should be taken,
and all in favour of the Scottish Queen. After
this followed a seditious general stirring up of
the common people into arms by circulating billets
in writing from one shire to another and from
town to town; which though the justices sought
to pacify, yet though it was stayed in one part it
rose up again in another; and by these seditious
practices sought to procure a rebellion. The
whole realm was greatly stirred. Her Majesty,
in view of these causes of danger likely to arise
to her own person and her realm, thought it needful
to have more regard how, if these dangers
should continue by these seditious persons and
stirrers of the common people, some factious and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
treasonable persons might by force recover the
Queen of Scots out of the house where she was,
there might be some order in readiness for prevention
thereof, and therefore she signed a writing
which had long before been devised, which
was an order to certain lords, the Earls of Kent,
Shrewsbury, Derby, Cumberland, and Pembroke,
that they or any three or two of them might have
authority to cause execution of justice to be done
on the Queen of Scots. Which writing so signed
was in the custody of her secretary Davison, who
took it to the Lord Chancellor to put the Great
Seal thereto, which was done very secretly, and
afterwards did declare the same to certain of the
lords and others of the Privy Council, who seem
glad thereof; and being at the same time greatly
troubled with daily reports from many parts of
the realm, of the seditious stirring up of people
to take arms, and seeing the....”</p>

<p>Left unfinished, 17th February 1587.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>It is by no means clear that Lord Burghley
was the writer of this paper. It is unfinished
and unsigned, two points against Burghley's
authorship. Burghley was unlikely to leave a
paper on this or on any subject unfinished. The
paper is reproduced from the Report of the Historical
MSS. Commission, and except the title,
there is nothing to identify it with Burghley. It
evidently belongs to one of two classes, namely, it
is either a forgery of Walsingham and Phillips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
or, if Burghley's, it is written under a total misapprehension
of the facts as recorded in the official
papers deposited in the State Paper Offices. The
age that produced it was pregnant with forgery.
Forgery, deciphering, and the surreptitious opening
and closing of letters, were at that period in
a high state of perfection. If we want an illustration
of this we have only to refer to the treatment
experienced by Mary and to the remarkably
cunning artifice of the brewer's cart,
<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> due
to the ingenuity of Walsingham, when every
letter she wrote or received was opened and
copied quite unknown to her. Again, no man
knew better than Burghley that Mary was
never except once arraigned for being concerned
in a plot against Elizabeth (Babington Plot), and
of which she was totally innocent. If she had
“ofttimes sought the destruction of the Queen's
Majesty,” we would have had some proof of it,
especially as every effort was made at the time
to publish slander against the Scottish Queen.
Considering the mock trial at Fotheringay and
the unfounded charges brought against her, none
of which Burghley could prove, we should think
it very unlikely that he would write such a paper
ten days after the execution. The primary object
of the paper was to defend Elizabeth's sentence
of execution, a sentence that could not be defended
without resorting to the most unblushing falsehoods
such as compose the text of this paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>At the last moment King James came forward
with a letter to Elizabeth on behalf of his mother.
He was very blameworthy not to have come
forward at an earlier stage. His letter need
surprise no one who has studied his character.
It had no effect whatever on Elizabeth. The
letter is dated 26th January 1587, and proceeds
to say:—</p>

<p>“I have resolved in few words and plain to
give you friendly and best advice, appealing
to your ripest judgment to discern thereupon.
What thing, madam, can more greatly touch me
in honour both as a King and as a son than that
my nearest neighbour, being in strictest friendship
with me, shall rigorously put to death a sovereign
prince and my natural mother? She being alike
in sex and state to her that so uses her; albeit
subject I grant to a harder portion, touching her,
too, so nearly in proximity of blood? What law
of God can permit that justice shall strike upon
them whom He has appointed supreme dispensers
of the same under Him, whom he hath called
gods, and therefore subject to the censure of
none on earth, whose anointing by God cannot
be defiled by man unrevenged by the author
thereof; they being supreme and immediate lieutenants
of God in heaven, cannot therefore be
judged by their equals on earth. What a monstrous
thing it is that sovereign princes themselves
should be the examples of the profaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of their own sacred diadems! Then what should
move you to this form of proceeding (supposing
the worst, which in good faith I look not for at
your hands): honour or profit? Honour were it
to you to spare when it is least looked for!
Honour were it to you, which is not only my
friendly advice but my earnest suit, to make me
and all the princes in Europe eternally beholden
to you in granting this my reasonable request!
And now, I pray you pardon my free speaking,
to put princes to straits of honour where through
your general reputation and the universal, almost
all, misliking, you may dangerously peril, both
in honour and utility, your person and state.
You know, madam, how small difference Cicero
concludes to be betwixt <i>utile</i> and <i>honestum</i> in his
discourse thereof, and which of them ought to
be framed to the other. And now, madam, to
conclude, I pray you so to weigh these few arguments
that if I ever presumed on your nature so
the whole world may praise your subjects for
their dutiful care of your person and for your
princely pity—the doing thereof only belongs to
you, the performing thereof only appertains to
you—and the praise thereof will ever be yours!
Respect then, good sister, this my first, so long-continued
and so earnest, request, and despatch
my ambassadors with such a comfortable answer
as may become your person to give and as my
loving and honest devotion unto you merits to
receive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>“But in case any do vaunt themselves to know
further of my mind in this matter than my
ambassadors do, I pray you not to take me to
be a chameleon, but, by the contrary, them to be
malicious impostors. And thus praying you
heartily to excuse my rude and lengthy letter, I
commit you, madam and dearest sister, to the
blessed protection of the Most High, who must
give you grace to resolve in this matter as may
be honourable for you and most acceptable to
Him.</p>

<p>After the attempt of James had failed the
Master of Gray (Patrick, 7th lord) was sent with
Sir Robert Melville to make a last effort. They
were long refused an audience of Elizabeth, and
when it was at last granted they could not help
asking themselves whether they had received a
favour or an insult. These ambassadors, in the
name of James and the Scottish nobles, answered
for all that Mary might thereafter attempt, and
proposed a resignation of her rights to the throne
of England in favour of her son. “That would be
arming my enemy with two rights instead of one,
and making him stronger to do me hurt,” said
Elizabeth. She scorned the idea of Mary's
resignation in favour of her son. “Is it so!” she
exclaimed; “then I put myself in a worse case than
before. By God's passion that were to cut my own
throat; and for a duchy or earldom to yourself, you
or such as you would cause some of your desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
knaves to kill me. No, by God! we shall never be
in that place.” Just as she was leaving, Melville
asked her to spare Mary's life for eight days.
“No,” replied she sharply; “not for an hour.”

</div>

<p>In the beginning of February 1587 Elizabeth
was thirsting for the blood of the Queen of Scots.
From the contemporary records of the time she
would seem to have been getting neither rest nor
sleep; and until the culminating act of the drama
had been accomplished there was no rest for her.
This act, which was to disgrace her memory for
all time, was now to be <i>un fait accompli</i>. The
following paper is the text of the royal commission
to those who were intrusted with the execution of
the Scottish Queen—the most discreditable commission
which was ever given by a Sovereign to a
subject. It is not too much to say that these men,
who had the awful duty to perform compulsorily,
must have had a heavy weight on their consciences
for the remainder of their lives.</p>

<p>We reproduce the text of the commission by
Elizabeth to the Earl of Shrewsbury, the Earl of
Kent, and others, to proceed to the execution of
the Queen of Scots, February 1587:—</p>

<p>“Elizabeth by the grace of God, etc., To our
right trusty and well-beloved cousins, George,
Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl Marischal of England;
Henry, Earl of Kent; Henry, Earl of Derby,
George, Earl of Cumberland; Henry, Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Pembroke, greeting:—Whereas the sentence
given by you and others of our Council, nobility,
and judges against the Queen of Scots, Mary,
daughter and heir of James the Fifth, late King of
Scots, commonly called the Queen of Scotland and
Dowager of France, as to you is well known. All
the states in our late Parliament assembled did
not only deliberately, with great advice, allow
and approve the sentence as just and honourable,
but did also with all humbleness and earnestness,
at sundry times require, solicit, and press us to
proceed to the publishing of the same, and thereupon
to direct such further execution against her
person as they did adjudge her to have duly
deserved, adding that the forbearing thereof was
and would be a certain and undoubted danger,
not only to our own life but to themselves, their
posterity, and the public state of this realm, as
well for the cause of the gospel and the true
religion of Christ as for the peace of the realm.
Whereupon we did, though the same was with
some delay of time, publish the sentence by proclamation,
and yet hitherto have forborne to give
direction for the further satisfaction of the aforesaid
request made by the states of Parliament
whereby we understand by all sorts of our loving
subjects, both nobility and council, and also of the
wisest and best devoted of all other our subjects
of inferior degrees, how greatly and deeply from
the bottom of their hearts they are grieved and
afflicted with daily, yea and hourly, fear of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
life, and thereby consequently with a dreadful
doubt and expectation of the ruin of this present
godly and happy state of the realm, if we shall
forbear the final execution as it is desired, and
neglect their general and continual requests,
prayers, counsels, and advices. And thereupon,
contrary to our own natural disposition, being
overcome with the evident weight of their counsels
and the daily continuance of their intercessions,
importing such a necessity as appears directly
tending to the safety not only of ourselves but
also of the weal of the realm. We have condescended
to suffer justice to take place, and for
the execution thereof upon the special trust,
experience, and confidence which we have in your
loyalty, faithfulness, and love, both towards our
person and the safety thereof, and also to your
native country, whereof you are noble and principal
members. We do, will, and by warrant hereof do
direct, and authorise you, as soon as you shall
have time convenient, to repair to our castle
of Fotheringay, where the Queen of Scots is in
custody of our right trusty servant and counsellor
Sir Amias Paulet, and there, taking her into your
charge, to cause by your commandment execution
to be done upon her person in the presence of
yourselves and the said Sir Amias Paulet, and of
such other officers of justice as you shall command
to be there, to attend upon you for that purpose.
And the same to be done in such manner and
form, and such time and place, there and by such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
persons as to you (five, four, three of you) shall
be thought convenient, notwithstanding any law,
statute, or ordinance to the contrary. And this
our Letters Patent, sealed with the Great Seal of
England, shall be to you and every one of you,
and to all who shall be present or shall be by you
commanded to do anything appertaining to the
aforesaid execution, a full, sufficient warrant and
discharge for ever. And further, we are also
pleased and contented, and by these presents we
do, will, command, and authorise our Chancellor
of England to deliver to each of you the duplicates
of these Letters Patent, to be for all purposes duly
made, dated, and sealed with our Great Seal of
England as these presents are.</p>

<p>The following letter was written by Queen
Mary to her almoner de Prean the evening before
her death, 7th February 1587:—</p>

<p>“I have striven this day for my religion and
against receiving my last consolation from the
heretics. You will hear from Bourgoyne and the
others that at least I made protestation of my
faith, in the which I will die. I require to have
you to make my confession and to receive from
you my sacrament. This has been cruelly refused
to me, as well as permission to carry away my
body and the power of leaving by will freely, or
of writing anything, except it pass through
their hands and by the good pleasure of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
mistress. I must therefore, confessing grief for
my sins in general, as I had intended to do to you
in particular, imploring you in the name of God
this night to watch for me, praying that my sins
may be remitted, and to send me your absolution
and pardon, if at any time I have offended you.
I shall endeavour to see you, though in their
presence as they have accorded to me my <i>maître
d'hôtel</i> (Melville), and if it is permitted me, before
them all on my knees I will ask your benediction.
Advise me as to the most proper prayers for this
night and for to-morrow morning. The time is
short and I have no leisure to write, but I will
recommend you with the rest (of her household)
above all. Your benefice shall be assured to you,
and I will recommend you to the King (of France).
Advise me of all you can think of for my soul's
help—by writing. I will send you a last little
token.</p>

<p>The following is the last letter Queen Mary
ever wrote:—</p>

<p>“Fotheringay, 8th February 1587:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, my Brother-in-law,—Having been
permitted by God, as I believe for my sins,
to throw myself into the arms of this Queen my
cousin, where I have had many troubles, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
where I have spent nearly twenty years, I am at
last by her and her Government condemned to
death, and having requested my papers (taken
away by them), to the end that I might make my
testament, I have not been able to select anything
that might be of use to me, nor to obtain
liberty to make a register of them, nor that after
my death my body might be conveyed according
to my desire to your kingdom, where I have had
the honour to be Queen, your sister, and former
ally.</p>

<p>“This day, after dinner, I received notice of
my sentence, that I should be executed to-morrow
like a criminal at eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>“I have not had leisure to give you a full
recital of all that has happened, but if it please
you to believe my physician, and the rest of these
my heart-broken attendants, you will hear the
truth, and how, thanks to God, I despise death,
and truthfully protest that I receive it innocent of
any crime so long as I have been in their power.
The Catholic religion and the maintenance of the
right which God has given me to this crown are
the two points of my condemnation—and yet
they will not allow me to say that it is for the
Catholic religion that I die, but for the fear of
changing theirs; and as a proof of this, they have
taken away my chaplain (to my sorrow), whom,
although he is in the house, I have not been able
to receive, either that he might come to confess
me or to administer the sacrament at my death,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
but they have greatly insisted on my receiving
the consolation and instruction of their minister,
brought hither for this purpose. The bearer of
this and his companions, the greater part of whom
are your subjects, will testify to you how I bear
myself in this my last act. It remains that I
pray you, as the most Christian King, my brother-in-law
and former ally, and as one who has always
professed your love for me, that at this time you
make proof of your virtue in all the points
following: first, of your charity—relieving me in
a matter which to satisfy my conscience I cannot
accomplish without your aid—to reward my
broken-hearted attendants, continuing to them
their wages; second, causing prayers to be made
to God for a Queen who has borne the title of
most Christian, and dies a Catholic, stript of all
her goods.</p>

<p>“As to my son, I recommend him to you so
far as he shall deserve, for I cannot answer for
him.</p>

<p>“I have taken the liberty of sending you two
rare stones for your health, wishing for you that
it may be perfect, with a happy and long life.
You will receive them as from your very affectionate
sister-in-law, who thus testifies to you in the
presence of death her kindly feelings towards
you.</p>

<p>“I recommend to you once more my attendants.
You will give orders, if it please you, that for my
soul I may receive payment of part of that which

you owe to me, and that to the glory of Jesus
Christ, to whom I shall pray for you to-morrow
at my death, you allow thereof sufficient to found
an obit for me, and to make the necessary alms.</p>

<p class="ac noindent"><span class="smcap">Bourgoyne's Journal</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span>
<i>Journal</i> of Bourgoyne, physician to Queen
Mary, cannot fail to have a pathetic interest to all
students of history. That eminent physician was
a faithful and devoted servant of the Queen, and
was one of the few who were privileged to be
with her in her last moments at Fotheringay.
He was a man of much refinement of feeling, if
we may judge from his <i>Journal</i> and by his
behaviour during that period. His <i>Journal</i> unfortunately
covers only the last six months of
the Queen's life. It would have been of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
value had it covered a longer period, but we
are glad to have it even as it is, as it contains
some incidents not otherwise recorded. The
minuteness of these details conveys sometimes a
different impression from that indicated by the
historian, but the importance of Bourgoyne's
<i>Journal</i> is that no suspicion has ever been
thrown around it; and though already published
in France, no controversy has arisen to question
its genuineness. It may be accepted as a <i>bonâ
fide</i> record, and indeed its entries are so circumstantial
as to leave no room for doubt. The
fact that he had uninterrupted access to the
Queen gives point to what he says and warrants
us in considering his record reliable. Another
matter not to be lost sight of is that we have
very little recorded of Mary during this period,
so that the <i>Journal</i> fills up a blank. Some of
the entries are very obscure on account of the
vernacular of the time, but they manifest the
fidelity and integrity which marked this devoted
servant of the Queen.</p>

<p>This <i>Journal per se</i> would not determine any
of the events of the Queen's reign, but it is an
important factor in exposing the fraud that was
perpetrated against her by the interpolations on her
letters to Babington. Bereft of these fabrications,
the so-called Babington Conspiracy was a mere plot
to release the Queen of Scots from captivity, a
plot that she was warranted in encouraging, and
a plot, notwithstanding the unfounded charges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
of her accusers, that has been approved by
posterity. It seems reasonable to conclude that
Bourgoyne wrote this <i>Journal</i> with the primary intention
of exposing the kidnapping outrage and the
unlawful and inexcusable treatment of the Queen
which followed. It will be noticed that in the very
first entry the outrage is hinted at as a “stag hunt.”
We now proceed to reproduce the <i>Journal</i>:—</p>


<p>“<i>Thursday, 11th August 1586.</i>—The Queen
sent Curle her secretary, who was accustomed
to be employed in her affairs, to Sir Amias
Paulet to let him know that she desired to walk
after dinner; to which Paulet answered that the
Queen could go if she wished; but if she was
well next day she would have a little pastime, as
Sir Walter Aston, who lived three miles distant,
would give her the pleasure of a stag hunt.
He wished her to kill the stag with her own
hand as she had done formerly, the year Mr.
Bagot had lived here. Her Majesty, very fond
of such a pastime, was delighted, and accepted
it; and although she hesitated because of the
day being Friday, she thought it better to accept
rather than lose so good an opportunity, which
might not occur again.</p>

<p>“<i>Friday, 12th August.</i>—Not so much because
of the fast as on account of the weather the hunt
was put off till the following day, but that day was
also unpropitious. Sunday and Monday passed,
being feast days. Her Majesty, who had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
forgotten the hunt, desired to have the promised
pastime, and, not suspecting anything, sent to
remind Paulet, who granted it. She put herself
in proper attire, hoping to see a good company,
and was followed by Nau (who did not forget
to dress himself), Curle, Melville, and Bourgoyne;
and Annibal, with the Queen's bows and arrows, all
on horseback, and well-equipped, to do her honour,
while everyone was merry over the anticipated
sport. (This was Tuesday, 16th August.)
Although nobody was permitted to go on foot,
Paulet allowed many of the valets to follow their
horses, the which he repented afterwards. The
Queen on horseback galloped a mile in such
mirth that we left Paulet with some of his
people behind in order to join others who were
in hiding not far away. Having passed a little
in front, the Queen warned Nau that Paulet was
behind. Wishing to pay him a compliment for
the delightful pastime, she said she had gone
in front, without remarking it, and that she
feared that he, being ailing and infirm in body,
could not follow the company so quickly. He
answered courteously, pretending that he had
been hindered by too great a number of valets
and servants on foot, who had come in greater
numbers than he wished. We advanced a little
farther, when Paulet again approached the Queen
and said, 'Madam, here is one of the bodyguard
of the Queen (Elizabeth), who has a message for
you;' and suddenly M. Gorges, Ambassador of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Elizabeth, dressed in green-braided serge, dismounted
from his horse, came to Her Majesty,
who remained on horseback, and said, 'Madam,
the Queen my mistress finds it very strange that
you, against the agreement which you made
together, have undertaken against her and her
estate what she never would have thought of
if she had not seen it with her own eyes. And
as she knows that some of your servants are
guilty, you will not take it ill that they are
separated from you; the rest Paulet will tell
you.' To which Her Majesty could only
answer, 'Very far from having conspired
against the Queen, I have not even had such a
thought. She has been wrongly informed. She
had always shown herself a good sister and a
good friend, and she knew well it was not the
first time that she had been misinformed and
had done her injustice.' Her Majesty added,
'I see we must return,' and called Nau, who
as quickly as he could approached her, but was
driven back with these words, 'Take him away,
take him away; don't allow him to speak to
her,' and Gorges got between them. Resisting
which, Nau maintained excitedly that they could
not hinder him from speaking to his mistress.
Gorges told him that he must not prevent him
from fulfilling the orders of Elizabeth. The
same was said to Curle, who cried out that he
would take leave of his mistress, and advanced
on a little country nag. Nau, who had a coach-horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
that he had taken in order to run better
and appear at the chase, was in danger of being
upset among the horses. At the last the two
turned away without speaking to the Queen, and
they never saw her again. Suddenly Paulet
ordered them to be disarmed of sword and
dagger, which those on horseback were carrying
without being prohibited. Then he commanded
each of us to be guarded by one of his servants
on horseback, to conduct us and be responsible
for us. Wade was present but did not interfere.
Nau and Curle were taken away into a village
and put into separate rooms not communicating
with each other, and Didier the butler was led
away by one of Paulet's people, not knowing what
he had done. Melville was taken to a house
where he only remained the night, being next
day taken to the house of M. Chaques, where he
remained, being allowed to hunt and walk at
leisure. The rest went on with the troop of
Paulet's people in front, for a mile or two quickly,
until I, who had put myself near the Queen and
always followed her, warned her that we were not
going the way we came, but that they were taking
us another way. Upon which she called Paulet,
who was riding in front. She said, 'We are not
going home.' He answered, 'No.' She demanded
to know where he was taking her, and he said,
'Not far.' But she said she wished to return
to her lodging, and would not go beyond it.
Upon which she dismounted, and being indisposed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and not able either to ride or walk, sat
down on the ground and leant on the bosom
of Elizabeth Curle, one of her attendants. She
again asked where he wished to take her, and
he answered, 'It would be to a good place, and
more beautiful than this; that she could not
return to her lodging, and that it was time lost
to remain there or to resist.' She said she would
die sooner than consent to this proposal. He
threatened to send for his carriage and put her
into it, ordering his people at the same time to
go for it. He was answered that the coach
horses were not there, for Nau had taken one
and Bastian Page the other. During this
interval those who went in front were in a
short time far away, out of sight of us, and saw
us no more, Paulet remaining alone with eight
or ten of his people, who walked behind, at
which I was much astonished. Her Majesty,
still seated, weeping and grieving said to him, 'It
was infamous to treat her in this manner, she
being a foreign princess; that it was behaving
traitorously; that they had given her in charge of
a gaoler, and that an honest man would not have
undertaken such a commission. She was a Queen,
as well as the Queen of England, and of as good a
house as she; that she ought not to be treated in
this fashion to please her enemies, who demanded
nothing but her ruin. She did not know why
these things were done; she had done nothing to
deserve them; she did not believe the Queen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
England intended this, but it was his (Paulet's)
bad counsel that was inimical to her; that they
had better take care what they did, for this act
might cause bloodshed and the death of many;
that kings and foreign princes would resent such
conduct, and take vengeance on England.'
Hearing this, Paulet got impatient and said 'She
must be quiet and not annoy herself any more, as
no harm would happen to her; that what he did
was for a good reason, and there was no remedy;
the longer she remained there the more harm it
would do, and she must go on.' On which I and
her people reminded her that she must have
patience; 'that in her time she had had many
afflictions, which she had borne patiently, and that
she must show herself firm and composed in this
with her royal heart; that she must endure affliction,
and that there was no resisting force. As to
being in the hands of her enemies, I did not think
it good that she should put herself still more in
their hands; that she could not remain there all
night; that the longer she lingered the worse it
would be, since she must set out; that not knowing
where they were leading her, she might be
benighted and on the road all night, which would
more easily give occasion to her enemies to hurt
her and execute their ill-will. What they did now
would be by force.' Then Her Majesty demanding
of Paulet if she had far to go, he said about three
miles, repeating that it was a beautiful place,
where she would be better lodged and would find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
fault in nothing. Complaining of the want of her
people, as also her clothes and night gear, Paulet
said that she would have her people; maids,
servants, and effects would all be there as soon
as herself. Because of their importunity she rose,
and being supported under each arm she retired
and under a tree prayed that God would have pity
on her people and on those who worked for her,
asking pardon for her offences, which she recognised
to be great and to merit punishment; that it
would please God to remember His servant David,
to whom he had extended His mercy and had
delivered from his enemies; that upon her his
hand might be stretched out, keeping her people
faithful and delivering her from the hand of
Pharaoh. She desired nothing in the world,
riches, honour, power, or worldly kingdom, only
the honour of His holy name. I raising her by the
arms got up, and not knowing what might be the
information—perhaps the Queen of England might
be ill or dead, and it might be that England wished
to make use of her to place her person in safety
or her enemies in surer custody. Upon which,
addressing Paulet, she said she did not know on
what authority he did this, and the Council had no
authority to treat her so. He said it was one
with as much authority as the Council, even was
the Council, and showed her a letter which he
drew from his pocket signed 'Elizabeth,' written by
a different hand, the summary of which was partly
the message of Gorges and partly giving orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
to detain the Queen until further notice. The
Queen complaining that she knew well it was the
work of her enemies, protested against the wrong
they were doing her, invoked God, and immediately
remounted. Being in such trouble, and
fearing they might do some harm to her, I begged
Paulet to have pity on a princess so afflicted and
in trouble, and hoped he would not do such a
wrong as to harm her life, and that he would
execute his commission as a discreet man; that as
courtesy and charity were always approved, no
matter in whom, so cruelty was condemned in
those who had the right to exercise it. Kings and
princesses often gave orders in anger of which
they were annoyed afterwards when these were
put in execution, and such men were complimented
when they did not execute them at once, and often
were more welcome to their prince, who had
cooled down, and regretting the order given, were
happy it was not executed. Further, he himself
was known to be wise and prudent, and capable
of judging everything, and could weigh it; that
having regard to the sex and quality of his
captive, he would thus acquire more honour than
by executing his command arbitrarily. It would
be a perpetual shame and reproach to him and his
posterity to have been employed in a cruel act.
Paulet answered that he did not take well what
I said; that he was no gaoler; that he was a
gentleman, although he was not rich; that he
was noble, faithful, and honest. Gaolers were for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
criminals, and she ought to be guarded like a
criminal. I said he was having to do with a
Queen who was in affliction. I thought no one
in such distress would not have said more than
she did, seeing no remedy nor succour and finding
danger so near. Paulet said no harm would
happen to Her Majesty, and that he would do as
well as he could. He thought she had been
badly advised. I answered if he thought Her
Majesty badly advised he might also think the
Queen his mistress had been badly informed; and
that as princes were often led by those whom they
favoured, so also they were often deceived; that
Her Majesty, though she had many enemies in
England, it was well known she was not without
friends. Some here who are at court near to
the Queen did not cease to annoy her, and found
no difficulty in bringing to notice what would do
her harm, and repeated many things that would
be found false. Leaving him, I advanced near
Her Majesty, and told her briefly part of the conversation
I had had with Paulet, assuring her from
him that she would experience no harm, and there
would be no want of requisite comforts and commodities.
When we had gone part of the way
Laurence, Curle's servant, held the bridle of the
Queen's horse and spoke to her. Paulet caused
him to be seized, not without great resistance, and
sent him to Chartley with Gorges. We now
approached Tixall, the seat of Sir Walter Aston,
where they led the Queen. Paulet approached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
her, and said it was necessary that Elizabeth
Pierrepoint should leave her; and then he presented
a gentleman named Chatham, who took
her in charge with great lamentation and tears,
as much on the side of Her Majesty as of the
demoiselle, who had been wicked and ungrateful.
Her Majesty, he said, ought rather to have
regretted ever having seen her than for being
parted from her.</p>

<p>“The Queen arrived at Aston's house and was
taken to her chamber. She sent me to ask what
Paulet had done with her butler. He answered
that he thought he was with her, and was surprised,
saying he must have been led away without orders.
He promised that he would be immediately in the
house, and sent for him, as also for the apothecary,
the surgeon Jervis, Jane Kennedy, Mowbray,
and Martin the cook, all of whom, remaining at
Chartley, had been shut up by Wade. After
supper Her Majesty sent to ask for her night
things, which were sent her; and as Paulet had no
power to accommodate her better, she being ill
and having need of many things, she requested
him to send her pen, ink, and paper to write to
Elizabeth. He refused the request, and she
replied that she thought it very strange that she
could not write, seeing it was a thing she had
always been free to do, and Elizabeth had begged
of her not to fail to write her in any circumstances,
asking if there was a new order prohibiting her
from doing so. She called for witnesses, and protested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
before them against the harsh manner in
which she was kept. Paulet said she might take
any witness she liked, but she could write no
letter until he had the authority of the Court.
After this interview she desired to see him again,
but he declined. Meantime, as they led the Queen
to this place, and Nau and Curle to the other,
Wade was at Chartley, where he caused all the
servants who remained behind to be shut up in
different parts of the house; all the maids and
the wife of Bastian, with Mrs. Curle, who was near
her confinement; seized all the keys of the doors
of the chambers and cabinets of the Queen and
as many coffers as he could, and the keys of those
who were absent with Her Majesty, and sealed up
all the locks that he could.</p>

<p>”<i>Wednesday, 17th August.</i>—Her Majesty being
still in bed, I was sent for by Paulet to speak
with him; but before doing so I asked if she had
anything to say to him. She said I must see first
if he would allow me. Then I was not permitted
to remount, but was taken to Chartley, where I
remained a prisoner with the others, waiting the
return of the Queen. They sent me there against
my will, resisting as much as possible, under the
pretext that I must be present when they visited
my chamber to answer for what they found.
After stating that my boxes were opened in my
room, and they could visit them without me, I was
promised that I would return the same day. This,
however, was not done. This and next day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Wade, Bagot, Manners, Knight of a great family,
who had even been employed in the troubles of
the Queen for the Duke of Norfolk, together
with Sir Walter Aston, in whose house the Queen
was detained—all these gentlemen were employed
searching the chambers, cabinets, coffers, and cash
boxes, papers, books, and everything they could
suspect as containing matter for their information.
This evening they brought away three coffers
filled with papers of all kinds, one part of which
was the private affairs of the Queen's household.
At four o'clock p.m. Pasquier, who had been confined
in a room separate from the others, was
taken to Chartley. And I immediately after
went to the cabinet of Her Majesty to find some
medicine for her, hoping to return at once, but
was sent back to the porter's lodge, where I had
been all day waiting until they should come down
from the Queen's room, which they did about
7 p.m. Then they searched my room, but found
nothing.</p>

<p>“<i>Tuesday, 23rd August.</i>—Mrs. Barbara Mowbray,
Curle's wife, had a daughter about 5 o'clock
a.m.</p>

<p>“<i>Wednesday, 24th August.</i>—We consulted to
have the child baptized, not having had news of
Her Majesty, who was still at Tixall. During
dinner M. du Prean was taken away, and the
same day Elspeth Bras and her mistress, Elizabeth
Pierrepoint. All the rest of us were much
astonished, only expecting that we also would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
separated, hoping at the same time that Her
Majesty might return the following day.</p>

<p>“<i>Thursday, 25th August.</i>—Her Majesty was
brought back to Chartley with a great company,
having been strictly confined at Tixall. She was
very welcome to each of us, as we held her in
great devotion, though not without tears abundantly
flowing on both sides. This day we
visited each other as those who had just come
home. After the tears had passed away Her
Majesty found nothing to say except about her
papers, which had been carried off. There was
found a cloth, from which had been torn off a
promise of marriage in parchment between Nau
and Elspeth Pierrepoint, which they had found
in one of that lady's coffers, who, consenting with
some others in the house, had signed the said contract
and kept it secret. Her Majesty was very
angry, as much for Nau's honour as for that of
Melville. Nau had made a solemn promise to
the Queen not to marry this lady nor make any
vow to her on the subject. Her Majesty several
times visited Mrs. Curle until the 6th or 7th
September, when Paulet sent to tell her that as
Mrs. Curle was now well there was no longer any
need of her being visited by the Queen, and that
such visitation had been allowed by Paulet for
charity and pity, as in the circumstances she was
not capable of attending an accouchement. In
the next twenty-four hours all her ladies were forbidden
to go out any more or go downstairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>.“</p>

<p>The next entry is ”<i>Tuesday, 13th September</i>.—Paulet
sent for me to say that Bagot had a few
words to say to Her Majesty, and wished to see
her. Her Majesty answered that she was very
ill and in bed, and not able to see him. She
begged of him to leave her alone for this day, not
being able to transact business of importance, and
that next day or any day she would do her best.
Paulet replied that it was not business of importance,
but Bagot had come expressly. It was
something he could not communicate to her people,
therefore she must hear it, and not trouble herself,
as it was only five or six words. Paulet said
he knew of her malady, but he desired that her
servants should not be in the room. He and
Bagot came immediately, followed by his son,
Gorges, Paulet, Darrell, D'Ispense, his principal
servitors, and gentlemen, a great number, with
swords and daggers. He entered the chamber
alone with Bagot, all the others remaining in the
antechamber, sending away all the ladies and
servants out of the room, which moved us much,
not knowing what to make of such behaviour.
The best that I could do was to stand at the door
under pretext that the Queen was alone, and had
two men with her. This they were unwilling to
allow, but at last it was allowed. At the same
time the surgeon remained with us. Paulet
remonstrated with the Queen on the troubles
which had come on the kingdom on her account,
stating they were warned that her money did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
much harm, that by it she suborned many people
in England and abroad, who behaved themselves
wickedly and traitorously to their country, and
that the Council advised that she must give up
her money into his hands. Her Majesty, much
astonished at this message, said that she had no
money and had never suborned anyone. On
Paulet giving some particulars, she said she had
never sought anyone, and if anyone offered to do
her a favour she did not wish to be ungrateful.
She had recompensed their trouble and recognised
the pleasure they wished to afford her in the place
in which she was. If they came to her she could
not refuse, and she did not wish to remain indebted
to them, and could not honourably remain
so. She had received letters and packets from
France and for her household from people that
she had never even known, and coming voluntarily
to her. She would submit to what they wished
if they proved that she had sought those people
or invited them to act so; otherwise she would not
deliver up her money, and it was not for Paulet
or the Council to command it. They had no
authority over her. Paulet said 'that she must,
and that he had brought Bagot as a witness,
assuring her that it would do harm to no one and
she would lose nothing. Things being as they
were, it was necessary that she should deliver
up her money, so that she might have no more
trouble; and that it would be better to give it up
voluntarily than be forced and create a disturbance.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Her Majesty refusing, Paulet told her
that if she did not give it up he would take it
by force. She said she recognised no one who
could order it, and refusing the key of her cabinet,
Paulet said he would break it open. She said
she knew he would not spare her. He desired
her to command Curle to deliver it up, but she
said she would do nothing of the kind. He left
the room to ask Elspeth Curle, who refused
without the authority of the Queen. We asked
him what he was going to do to the Queen so sick
and afflicted. He replied he would do her no
harm. After having gone to Her Majesty pretending
to force the door, Elspeth Curle was called,
and gave up the key by order of her mistress.
The Queen, seeing herself alone in the chamber
guarded by Paulet's people, whom no one dare
approach, rose from her bed and followed them,
walking with difficulty, and remonstrated with
them about this money. Paulet was informed by
Wade where and how much it was, and how much
belonged to Curle. It was money that she had
kept for a long time as a last resource when she
was about to die so as to pay for her obsequies;
also to pay for sending her servants to their own
country after her death. This they would see
by her papers, amongst which they would find
a duplicate of her will, which she had made with
her own hand, in which was a list of those to
whom she desired the money to be given, and
how much to each. She had promised to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
counsel not to touch it, and by his advice she
reserved it for this purpose. She had even
sworn not to break into it, nor to take a penny
herself, nor allow anyone else to do so during her
life. As they would not consent, she begged
them to leave at least a part for necessities;
being ill, it was not right to leave her without
money. Paulet answered that she would want
for nothing. They would furnish her with everything,
but they would leave no money in her
hands. And so they went away and left her with
ten crowns. They went to Curle's room to seize
the money he had had for his marriage, and were
obliged to remain and take the money from his
sister Elspeth, who had it in her keeping, upon
which at her request they promised a receipt, but
refused it when she had given up the money.
Upon this Paulet led Catherine Bras into Mrs.
Curle's room, where she remained several days.
Next day Bastian Page and all his family were sent
to their room; Mrs. Curle, her nurse, and Catherine
to hers; Baltazare, Robin Morton, Nicholas and
Charles, to the robe room, and afterwards,
at the request of Her Majesty, Robin Morton
was given to her instead of Baltazare, and from
that time not one of these saw her again. Some
days after, Mary, daughter of Bastian Page, was
taken away from the side of the Queen while she
was at dinner. Not wishing to go, she remained
with her father until they sent for her. So there
only remained with the Queen Jane Kennedy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Renee Beauregard, Gillies Mowbray, Elspeth
Curle, maids of honour; Jervis, surgeon, and
Guon, apothecary; Annabel Stuart, <i>valet de
chambre</i>; Didier, butler; John Lauder, baker;
Hust, chef; etc. After getting permission to
serve the Queen, the same day they were shut
up with the coachman, two other grooms, and
the stablemen, without having any communication
with the outside world. Thus we remained in
doubt from one day to another whether we should
be separated and sent away.</p>

<p>“Some days afterwards Paulet asked if he
could see the Queen, and if she would listen
quietly and not abuse him.” Coming to her
accompanied by Bagot, who spoke more
particularly of these troubles
—“since England was there had never been any so great. There
had never happened any enterprise so horrible
(Babington Conspiracy). If she was guilty or
consenting God knew it. But there were those
who had plotted great things, among others
Babington. Six men had undertaken to kill
Elizabeth, and were to carry away the Queen of
Scots, set fire in the night-time to the outside
barns, and so draw the attention of Paulet and
his people and upset some carts to prevent them
re-entering; afterwards kill Paulet, and carry the
Queen away with some of her servants. Two or
three miles from her house, near the warrens,
there would be a number of horses to conduct her
in safety far away to another locality. It was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
great matter if she consented to it; that she ought
to know who it was, and if she thought she was
badly counselled; that she had had servants as
wicked as it was possible to find; that Nau had a
mind so restless that he could not be stopped.
He wished everything he suggested done immediately;
and he had a certain ambition that
he could not bear anyone above him. He
wished to command and be master everywhere,
would give place to nobody, and had done her a
great deal of harm.” Her Majesty said she knew
nothing of all that. She did not know Babington,
and had never heard of these plots against
Elizabeth. As to her servants, they had only
counselled good and worthy things. If they had
wished to undertake plots she was not so destitute
of sense that she did not know what course to
pursue. That she had had long experience in
this dispute with Elizabeth to enable her to
choose between the true and the false. Paulet
maintained that Babington had confessed great
things, that the Catholics were going to revolt,
and that he thought he had accused Her Majesty;
that she could not deny that she had been acquainted
with him, and that she had written to
him and he to her; and that she had had intercourse
with many countries and peoples in that
enterprise. She answered that formerly she had
heard of Babington, but that was ten years ago;
that she did not know what had become of him,
and had neither seen nor known any other person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
nor had intercourse nor undertaking with anyone.
She sometimes received letters from her friends,
which were offered of their goodwill to give her
pleasure, but she had undertaken nothing of this
kind; she had suborned nobody. Often she
received letters from people of whom she had
never heard, and others she did not know whence
they came nor from what part. Brasseur de
Loges had brought her many packets without
knowing from whom they came and without
having spoken or having cognisance of anyone
belonging to her, said he had borrowed money
from her; that for pity, making her believe he
was in trouble, she had lent it to him, but she had
not suborned or bribed him by any means whatever
nor even spoken to him. They could not
hinder her from having news and correspondence,
and she was not accountable to them; it was her
own affair. It was unnecessary that all her affairs
should be known. Paulet importuned her to
confess something, and tried to obtain proof
from her words, and said that they must speak
more fully to her and make her clear up everything.
From this she thought she would be tried,
but nobody thought in what fashion it would be
done.</p>

</div>

<p>“<i>Thursday, 15th September.</i>—Paulet sent to
warn her that it would be for the benefit of her
health and for her convenience, and also because
she had wished it, the house of Chartley being
unhealthy, that she move to another house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
belonging to the Queen of England thirty miles
from London, where she would be very well, and
she might prepare herself to go there when it
pleased her. He would give her back her money
when she got to her destination. (He never did so.)
She desired nothing else, ill though she was, and
would rather go soon for fear of becoming worse.
In two or three days she would be ready to set
out. From that time we began to pack up and
prepare for the departure, which would be on
Tuesday following, the twentieth of the month.
It was ultimately fixed for to-morrow, because
of the appointed house being changed and
Fotheringay, a castle of the Queen of England,
substituted, so that it was necessary to give fresh
orders to the carters, who had set out for another
place. These things were told secretly and not
very assuredly. The Queen was never quite sure
where they would take her, not even the last day,
when she arrived at her new quarters. Before
setting out in the morning they usually told her
whether she would have a long or a short journey,
sometimes how many miles. They never would
tell her the place where she was to remain over
night. When they were preparing for their
departure Paulet told the Queen of a request
from Bastian to get some reward and some money
for his journey, not only for himself but for the
other servants: those who were in the house as
well as for Melville and Prean, who were some
miles away. Her Majesty refused flatly to allow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Paulet to distribute her money, requesting them
to give it to her that she might dispose of it
at her pleasure; she would not make him her
treasurer, fearing the consequences. After some
debate she gave in and asked them to send two
hundred crowns to be distributed by Paulet. Paulet
said he would give what she wished to each with
a receipt, but was resolute that she was not to
touch any money. At last she was constrained
to make a memorandum written by her own hand
and signed, that Bastian should have forty crowns,
Curle thirty-six, and Baltazare ten; also ten to
Nicholas, Laurence, and Charles; to Henry his
entire wages of twenty crowns and thirty shillings,
and to Elizabeth Butler, laundry maid, twenty
crowns, and to Alice Sharp and Alice Forster forty
shillings each, letting it be known that what she did
was by constraint and for pity. Should her servants
be in danger of want or unprovided with money for
the journey, she would recommend them for the rest
to the French Ambassador, who would give them
sufficient to complete their journey to France, where
they would be paid their wages and have each a
fitting reward. I have been informed that the
money was not given for a long time thereafter.</p>

<p>“<i>19th September.</i>—Sir Thomas Gorges, a
gentleman pensioner of Elizabeth, who had led
away Nau and Curle as prisoners, arrived by post
horse with Stallenge, Usher of Parliament, with
their pistols at their belt. We thought they had
come for some evil purpose, and we were only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
assured on Wednesday when we saw them speak
to Her Majesty more courteously than we expected.
The Wednesday following, which was
St. Matthew's Day, 21st September, the Queen
being ready to set out, all the doors of the rooms
where the servants were were shut, for fear they
might speak to her or see her. She went by
carriage, not being able to go on horseback, and
sat with her back to the coachman, partly for
comfort and partly because of her demoiselles and
things required on the journey, which were in the
back part of the carriage; and partly to see better
what was going on behind her, thinking if they
wished to do her harm she would see the blow
coming; besides, she could speak to her coachman
and ask what they were doing.</p>

<p>“On setting out from Chartley she was escorted
by Gorges, who with Stallenge were charged to
do so because Paulet could only travel by coach;
and there was also their safety on the road. These
men took the lead of several others (spies), and
there were about two hundred horse. Each
horseman wore the livery of his master; none of
them had bows, few had harquebuses, while most
had swords and daggers. One-half were in
front, the other half behind. In the middle the
Queen and her servants, and near her Paulet in
his coach, his wife and family in another; his
people, his servants and horsemen, surrounding
the company, all with harquebuses and lighted
torches and a couple of pistols at the saddle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Gorges travelled at the side of the Queen's
carriage. He said he had something to tell her
from his mistress. She said she prayed God that
his message might be better and more agreeable
than the last. He answered that he was merely
a servant, on which she was content, telling him
that she did not blame him. After this there was
little intercourse on the way until she dismounted
at Burton in Staffordshire. Having conducted
her to her room, Gorges said he wished to speak
to her, but feared to trouble her, she being tired
with the journey.”</p>

<p>“<i>Thursday, 22nd September</i> 1586.—Her
Majesty prepared to resume her journey. Being
in great uneasiness, she sent to ask Gorges what
he had to tell her: which was that Elizabeth
thought it very strange, and would never have
thought that she would have been accessory to
those things which had been discovered against
her, she being a relation and of the same rank.
To think of laying hands on a consecrated
Queen, Gorges said his mistress was never so
astonished. She was so angry with what had
happened that she knew well if she had sent Her
Majesty into Scotland she would not have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
safe and her subjects would have been against
her. To have sent her to France, of which there
was no intention, they would have thought her a
fool. Her Majesty answered that she had never
undertaken nor thought of undertaking anything
against the Queen of England or her kingdom,
and that she had not so little prudence as to
wish to conspire against Elizabeth or put her
hands upon a consecrated Queen. She knew
not if Elizabeth had done like Saul. In place of
thinking such a thing, she had cautioned her
repeatedly of what she knew would be hurtful
to her interests. But there were many people
who had different schemes, so that if she would
communicate with her, together they could put
things in order, and by those means she would be
assured. In this she had never been listened
to but rather despised and ill-treated, not like a
prisoner of her rank but like as if taken in war
or even worse, as if they had the power of life
and death or a right to torment and afflict her,
taking away from her all the conveniences of
life, so that she was without power to communicate
with friends or relations, nobody whatever. She
was shut up, kept under the order of a man
without whose will she could do nothing. That
he had been as strict with her as he could, not
only as to her liberty and captivity, but concerning
her eating and drinking, for herself and household.
During her captivity the Queen of England had
maintained, sustained, and aided her rebel subjects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
alienated her son from her, taken away what she
possessed, and even now had made a league with
him separating her from him; and in this league
she was forsaken and rejected like an abject and
abandoned person, without comfort or hope and
deprived of all her means. From then till now
she had therefore not been able to communicate
with anyone. If all the Christian primates her
relations, friends, and allies, moved with pity
and compassion for her ill fortune, had thought
it their duty to compassionate her misery, she
could not have done less than throw herself into
their arms and put herself at their mercy. She
knew none of their designs, what were their
schemes, or what they intended to do. She did
not mix herself up with these and had in no way
mixed herself up in the world. And whatever
they had done or intended to do, it was for them
to answer, not her. That the Queen of England
knew well that she had warned her to pay attention
to her and her counsel, as perhaps the foreign
kings and princes would undertake something
for her benefit. Upon the whole the Queen of
England answered her that it was all right as to
foreigners and subjects, and she had only to do
with her. There was no reply, except that Gorges
answered that he prayed God that it might be so.
Afterwards they only spoke twice on the way,
Paulet doing his best to accommodate her on the
road for lodging and commodities required on the
journey. Having set out from Burton at 11 a.m.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
on Thursday, 22nd September, we arrived at Hill
Hall Castle, Abbots Bromley, belonging to the
Earl of Huntingdon, seven miles from Burton,
where we remained for the night. Next day, 23rd
September, we set out at 10 a.m. and arrived at
Leicester, fifteen miles distant, where Her Majesty
lodged at a hotel in the suburbs called 'the Angel.'</p>

<p>“The Corporation made Paulet a present of
wine, but a feeling so hostile to him and his coadjutors
was manifested by the people of Leicester
that it was found necessary to hire three men
to watch his coach lest it should be destroyed
or carried off during the night.
<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>“On 24th September we set out about the
same hour, and arrived pretty late in Rutlandshire
at the house of Roger Smith.</p>

<p>“On Sunday, 25th September, we arrived at
Fotheringay. Her Majesty on arrival, and next
day, complained of the want of proper accommodation
for herself and servants. It seemed
as if Paulet wished to please her by giving her
more room. He caused the private doors to be
built up because he was afraid for her safety.
One day we had a dispute. The Queen complained
much of Paulet in the presence of
Stallenge, who remained in the castle, Gorges
having left for London. The complaint was
about her lodging, as she saw so many beautiful
rooms uninhabited. He replied that the lords
of the Council were coming to occupy these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
rooms. She suspected they were coming to
interrogate her. This gave her no trouble, but
rather seemed to raise her spirits and rejoice her
heart more than usual.</p>

<p>“<i>Saturday, 1st October.</i>—Paulet sent a message
that he would like to say a few words to her.
He was accustomed to use this language when
he had anything disagreeable to tell her. Having
come into her presence, he said that Elizabeth,
having had the report from Gorges, was much
surprised that Her Majesty had had such a conversation
with him, seeing she (Elizabeth) could
show the contrary, having sufficient proof to
contradict what she said; that she was to send
some lords and councillors to speak to her, the
which, in order that she might not be surprised,
he gave her due notice of; that it would be
better for her to ask pardon of Elizabeth and
confess her fault than to be declared guilty,
and that he would advise her to do this, and he
would report it, being ready to write her answer
such as it was. Her Majesty, smiling ironically at
this proposal, said to him his speech suggested
what one was accustomed to say to children when
they wished them to confess. She knew she had
offended her Creator in many things, and she asked
pardon of Him, but that she was a sovereign Queen,
and recognised no offence or fault that she had to
confess to anyone; that as she could not commit
any fault she could not ask any pardon, and did not
wish to receive any; and ironically she said they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
would not go very far; she thought they took
much pains for very little, and would not advance
their cause very much. Paulet interrupted her
and said that he could not confirm what she had
written and therefore she had better confess, for
the thing was notorious, and that he would send
on her answer. Whereupon, having begged Her
Majesty to listen, he repeated her response in order
that he might write correctly, asking if this was
her meaning; to which she assented. The same
day Paulet wrote to the court. Before leaving
he told her that if she wished to have Melville,
her <i>maître d'hôtel</i>, with her he would come,
as he (Paulet) had to go to London in order to discharge
Bagot, who gave him trouble and expense.</p>

<p>“<i>Thursday, 6th October.</i>—I with Marie Page
at the door informed the Queen that Melville had
come with Paulet's daughter, if she would receive
her. Much astonished, Her Majesty agreed.</p>

<p>“<i>Sunday, 9th October.</i>—Paulet discharged
Roger, Sharp, Laurence, Barlae and Jackson,
having first informed her. She ordered Sharp to
be paid seventy pounds besides his wages, twenty
crowns, and one horse as a gift; to Jackson his
wages of ten crowns and forty shillings, with one
horse; to Laurence his wages; and as for Aroburn,
it was agreed that he could remain to tend the rest
of the horses; forty sols (sous) to him. And that
he might better serve Sharp, she gave him the little
mare in charge until she foaled, that the two
might be disposed of as pleased her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Tuesday, 11th October.</i>—The Lords arrived.
Most of them slept in the village, the others at
Monde, Mardelemat, at Nayde and Fotheringay,
and numbered about fifty. Forty-two of these
were chosen by commission. There were only
forty-eight in the memorandum given to Her
Majesty, of whom nine were absent. There
arrived a man named Phal (perhaps Dr. Ford),
an emissary of Walsingham, who translated French
into English; one named Barker, who wrote his
answers and gave the papers to a notary or clerk
of court; another who seemed to be an usher or
master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>“<i>Wednesday, 12th October.</i>—They came to the
castle and attended preaching and prayers at the
chapel, and sent Sir Walter Mildmay and Barker
and Stallenge the usher, who presented a letter
to the Queen from Elizabeth without any title
such as Madam—simply signed at the end
'Elizabeth' without 'your sister,' and sealed
with the Great Seal. Above the superscription
'To the Scotch,' as speaking to the people. She
said that after the opinion which she held, having
dared to deny being guilty of what they could
prove, not wishing to receive any arbiter it seemed
good to send her lords and councillors, lawyers,
skilful in the practice of the laws of her kingdom,
who she had authorised and empowered to proceed
as they thought best, and that the Queen of Scots,
being under her protection and in her kingdom,
was subject to the laws of the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter is of considerable importance, and
as Bourgoyne does not give it, we have found
what we think is the same letter in the State
Paper Office. It is in the following terms:—</p>

<p>“Whereas we are given to understand that you,
to our great and inestimable grief (as one void of
all remorse of conscience), pretend with great
protestations not to be in any sort privy or
assenting to any attempt either against our state
or person, forasmuch as we find by most clear
and evident proof that the contrary will be
verified and maintained against you; we have
found it therefore expedient to send to you divers
of our chief and most ancient noblemen of this
our realm, together with certain of our Privy
Council, as also some of our principal judges, to
charge you both with the privity and assent to
that most horrible and unnatural attempt. And
to the end you may have no just cause, living as
you do within our protection, and thereby subject
to the laws of our realm, and to such trial as by
us shall be thought most agreeable to our laws,
to take exception to the manner of our proceedings;
we have made special choice of these
honourable persons to be used in this service,
having for that purpose authorised them by
commission under our Great Seal to proceed
therein; and therefore do both advise and
require you to give credit and make answer to
that which these honourable persons authorised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
by us shall from time to time during their abode
there deliver unto you in our name as if it were
to ourselves. Given at our castle of Windsor,
6th October 1586.”</p>

<p>“Her Majesty said that this letter was a
mandate and written as to a subject; that she
was Queen and a born daughter of a Queen, a
foreigner, and the nearest relation of the Queen
of England; that she had come to England on
the promise that had been made to her to give
her help against her enemies and subjects, and
was thereupon made prisoner, the which she had
been for eighteen years, ill-treated always and
afflicted and troubled by their continued persecution.
She had several times suggested suitable
conditions; she had many times asked to speak
with Elizabeth, was ever willing to serve and do
her pleasure, but she had been always influenced
by enemies; that she, as a free Queen, could not
accept commands, nor respond to laws, without
hurting herself, the King her son, and all other
sovereign princes. That she was of the same
estate, majesty, and dignity, and would not
submit, neither she, her heirs, or her country, as a
valet had done (referring to Moray); she would
rather die. She challenged her judges as being
contrary to her religion; she did not recognise
the laws of England, did not know them, did not
understand them, and many times had made this
protest. She demanded that former protests be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
taken account of; that she was alone, without
counsel; that her servants had been taken away,
also those who knew and had managed her affairs
and had cognisance of laws and formalities; that
there was no criminal so poor who might not
have someone to speak for him. They had taken
away her papers, memoranda, evidences of her
past experience, so that she was destitute of all
aid, taken by surprise, and ordered to obey and
answer people who had been instructed for a long
time. The greater part of them were evil disposed
to her and only sought her ruin.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>The State Paper Office contains a rather
different version of this interview, which it will be
interesting to compare with that of Bourgoyne.
It is as follows:—</p>

<p>“Relation of an interview between Sir Walter
Mildmay, Sir Amias Paulet, and Edward Barker,
and the Queen of Scots:—</p>

<p>“Upon the repair of Sir Walter Mildmay, Sir
Amias Paulet, and Edward Barker to the Scottish
Queen, and the delivery of Elizabeth's letters, the
Scottish Queen read the same and thereupon said
she was very sorry that the Queen her good
sister was so evil informed of her after so many
offers made on her behalf. Notwithstanding any
assurance given to Elizabeth by her and her
friends, she found she was neglected, and that
though she had forewarned things dangerous to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Her Majesty and the State, she was not believed
but contemned. This grieved her much, she
being Her Majesty's nearest kinswoman, saying
that the association made here and the Act thereupon
passed in Parliament gave her sufficient
understanding what was intended against her.
She added that she saw well whatever danger
should happen to Her Majesty, either through the
instrumentality of foreign princes, the discontent
of private persons, or matters of religion, it
would all be laid upon her, for she had many
enemies. After some other words to the same
effect, and a recital of a long-endured captivity
and of some supposed unkindnesses offered to
her, she said that a league had been made
between Her Majesty and the King her son
without her consent or knowledge. For answer
to Her Majesty's letter she said she found it very
strange that Her Majesty wrote in such sort, for it
was in the nature of a command and that she
should answer as a subject; but for her part she
was born a Queen, and she would not prejudice
her rank and state, nor the blood whereof she
was descended, nor her son who was to follow
her, nor would give so prejudicial a precedent
to foreign princes, as to answer according to the
desire of those letters. For her heart could not
yield to any compulsion. She referred to the
protestation which she had already made to the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord de la Warr, and
others, adding that she was ignorant of the laws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and statutes of the realm, that she was destitute
of counsel and knew not who were her competent
peers, also that her papers were taken from her
and that nobody dared or would speak on her
behalf. After this she solemnly protested that
she was innocent and had not procured or
encouraged any hurt against Elizabeth, and that
she was not to be charged but by her word or
writing, as she was sure that neither the one nor
the other could be shown against her, confessing
notwithstanding, that after so many offers made
by herself and not accepted by Elizabeth, she
remitted herself and her cause to foreign princes.”</p>

<p>Mary's sentiments having been communicated
to Elizabeth, she wrote Mary as follows:—</p>

<p>“You have in various ways and manners
attempted to take my life and bring my kingdom
to destruction by bloodshed. I have never
proceeded harshly against you, but, on the contrary,
protected and maintained you like myself. These
treasons will be proved to you and will be made
manifest. Yet it is my will that you answer the
nobles and peers of the kingdom as if I myself were
present. I therefore require, charge, and command
you, that you make answer, for I have been
well informed of your arrogance. Act candidly,
and you will receive the greater favour of me.”
<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>“Sir Walter Mildmay repeated her conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
and then went and reported it to the Council,
which was assembled in a chamber adjoining.
This finished, all separated, and went to their
places of abode. Paulet, Barker, and Stallenge
came to the Queen from the Council, who having
heard Her Majesty's answer to Elizabeth's letter
found it good to have it written and communicated
to her that she might verify it. Therefore
Barker on his knees read it to her, rewritten in a
good style without anything forgotten except that
she wished to speak to Elizabeth. She verbally
approved it without any signature.</p>

<p>“<i>Thursday, 13th October.</i>—Paulet, Barker, and
Stallenge came to her about ten o'clock in order
to ask if it would please her to hear the
commissioners, who wished to speak to her.
Being willing, they entered her chamber each in
their order with great ceremony, one marching
before the other bearing seals or the arms of the
Chancellor. Then the Chancellor, speaking first,
said he came by command of the Queen of
England, she being informed that the Queen of
Scots was charged with some plot or enterprise
against her person or estate, with authority to
examine her on certain charges, and upon her
answer to proceed as the Council were disposed.
She told them that she had seen the letter of the
Queen of England, and that she had replied to it
the day before. She said this with tears, moving
everyone to pity. Burghley, a very vehement
man, speaking for the others, said that the Council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
had seen the answer and he had taken the advice
of the law doctors who were versed in civil and
canonical law, who after deliberation had found
that, notwithstanding her answer, he must proceed
with the examination, and therefore the lords had
come to examine her; that she might say whether
she would hear them or not, because if she refused
they would proceed according to their commission.
Her Majesty remonstrated about her rank and
that she was not a subject, to which they replied
that Elizabeth recognised no Queen in her
kingdom but herself. As to them, they would
not speak to her as to a subject; they knew well
her origin and rank; that their commission was
not to give way to this, only to examine her upon
international and civil and canonical laws. After
some conversation touching her bad treatment
and the severity she had endured, the commissioners,
seeing she would not consent to be
examined because she was not a subject, went
away. After dinner she made some memorandums
with her own hand to refresh her memory
when the commissioners returned, as she could
not remember everything. Her heart swelled
with affliction; her spirits seemed to awaken and
become stronger, so that she was able to debate
the cause when she was rudely assailed by the
commissioners, and said more than she had written.
These returned after dinner, when she demanded
the indictment of the Queen; what she meant by
the word 'protection'; why she (the Queen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Scots) had come into England, and with what
intention. Burghley, who always did the speaking,
was irritated, and said that he had seen the letter,
and what had been written had explained itself.
It would be presumptuous to undertake to interpret
the letters of his mistress. That did not
belong to them. The Queen said he was not so
ignorant of the mind of Elizabeth as not to know
her will and intention. If he had power to
interpret to the Council he had also power and
authority to interpret the Queen's letter to her.
Burghley denying that he had power to do so, said
he knew well the Queen's intention, namely, that
everyone in her kingdom should be subject to the
laws, and what he wished to know was whether
she would listen to the commissioners or not, or
that they might proceed without her. She said
she knew this letter was the invention of
Walsingham, who had confessed to being her
enemy; that she had suspected him as such, and
he knew well what he had done against her and
her son. Thereupon they debated among themselves
if Walsingham was in London when the
letter was written, but they came to no decision.</p>

<p>“This same afternoon they sent Paulet before
the commissioners came, with an attorney and
Bagot and Stallenge, saying that Her Majesty
had desired the duplicate of the commission or the
principal points of it, and that this had been
granted. The Council sent her the roll of the
commissioners, explaining the points and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
subject of the commission, which was founded by
two Acts of Parliament passed two years before,
namely, that they must not talk of the succession
of the Scottish Queen during the life of Elizabeth,
nor of anyone of any station, rank, or dignity
whatsoever outside or inside the kingdom. They
imagined or consented to the death of the Queen.
A certain number (I think eighty) elected and
assembled could judge. Therefore she who they
called Mary Stuart had consented to the horrible
deed of the destruction of her person and the
invasion of her kingdom. She would be interrogated
by the commissioners upon this point,
and they would judge her as they found good.
To a great part of this which was read Her
Majesty took exception, such as she did to the
assembled lords later, and upon their report demanded
them to come and speak to her, which
they did. She again referred to her not being
subject to the laws. They said that if she was
reigning peaceably in her kingdom and someone,
were it the greatest king on earth, were to conspire
against her, she would not recognise him as a
king but would proceed against him. She said
she would never act in such a fashion, and that
she saw quite well they had already condemned
her. What they were doing was only a formality,
but what she did was not for the sake of her life.
She was fighting for her honour, for those belonging
to her, and for the Church. Then she attacked
what they said in the morning about the civil and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
canonical law; that it had been made by the
Romish Church, who did not follow them; that
they only bound those in this kingdom who could
make use of them, since they neither approved
nor received the authority of him who had the
right by succession. Burghley answered that as
to them they made a common use of the canonical
law in many matters, such as marriages, etc., the
authority of the Pope excepted. She replied
wisely that he could not in consequence approve
the right of him when he disapproved the
authority, he being the sole interpreter of those
in the same Church. She knew nobody in
England to whom he had delegated this
authority. After this observation they were
obliged to change the subject, seeing that they
were not able to answer without doing wrong to
their religion and government. Her Majesty said
that the civil laws made by ancient Catholic
emperors, or at least received and approved by
them, could only be used by those who approved
their actions; and as they were difficult to understand
and put in force, each wished to interpret
them according to his fancy, therefore they had
founded universities in France, Italy, and Spain
to teach them. Those who had none could not
have the true version, but interpreted them at
their own will. If they wished to judge her
according to these laws, she would like to have
people from these universities, so as not to be
judged by lawyers who served the laws of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
England. She told them that she saw quite
well they rejected the civil and canonical law
and wished to subject her to the laws of the
country. She did not know these laws; it was
not her profession, and they had taken away her
means of learning them. Kings and princes had
people near them versed in these, she had none;
they had taken them away, therefore she desired
to be informed how they were in the habit of
acting toward those similarly situated. They
said if she pleased she might hear the judges
and lawyers who had come; she could then learn
what was the law on this point. At first she was
content until she perceived by Burghley's proposal
that they meant her to understand that she had a
bad case, that she was subject to the laws, and
that they had a right to cause her to be judged
by them. She, seeing that she could not remonstrate
with them without humiliating herself,
refused to hear them further. They proposed
the reading of the other commission. She refused
the request, suspecting that they were making laws
expressly to convict her, and that they wished to
dispossess her of her right of succession to the
kingdom. She was answered that they were
indeed new laws, and that they were as just and
equitable as any others before God and justice;
that she knew well it was necessary from time to
time to abrogate some and to make others. She
replied that the new laws could not affect her,
being a stranger and not subject to them. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
confessed to being a Catholic, and for that religion
she wished to die and shed the last drop of her
blood; that she was ready, and would esteem
herself happy if God would give her grace to die
in this cause. They, astonished at the firmness
of her attitude, pressed her no longer and reserved
their answer. She asked for the protest she had
made at Sheffield. The Chancellor and the
Treasurer read the duplicate as they had
promised in the morning at her request when
they had presented the original, but would not
leave it with her as they had no authority to do
so. They confessed that the Chancellor took it,
being one of the deputies at Sheffield in the cause
of the Duke of Norfolk. He had taken charge
of her and represented her, but it had never been
received nor approved, and she would not make
use of it. The Queen of England had a right in
her kingdom over everyone who plotted against
her without respect of quality or dignity; at the
same time one could see how honourably the
Queen had proceeded, having chosen such an
honourable company of lords and nobles of the
kingdom, commissioners to proceed in this
matter, assuring her that nothing had been
done against her; they were not judges, only
examiners.</p>

<p>“The rest of the day passed in these agitated
conversations until night, when Hatton spoke
saying they debated many things which did not
belong to their commission, and that they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
only come because the Queen their mistress was
warned that Her Majesty had consented to what
had been undertaken against her person, her State,
and the public peace. It was a question whether
she was guilty or not. It seemed to him that
Her Majesty ought not to refuse to be examined;
answering would make evident her innocence,
which would be an honour to her and a comfort
to the Queen and all the lords, whether present
or absent. It was the last speech Her Majesty
made to him, with tears; that nothing had ever
touched his heart or grieved him so much as to
come here to undertake such a case against her.
Her Majesty asked what recompense she would
have when she had proved her innocence, and
what reparation would be made to her for having
been in prison so long and accused. They replied
that no harm would happen, and she would be
honoured, and it would satisfy their mistress.</p>

<p>“She remained all night in perplexity, and at
last resolved to intimate to the commissioners
that she wished to speak to them before they
assembled.</p>

<p>“<i>14th October 1586.</i>—This day they came with
other Lords, including Walsingham, who had not
attended the previous day. She thus addressed
them:—'Sirs, consider my rank, having been
born a Queen, a foreigner, a near relation to your
Queen. It cannot surprise you that I should be
offended at the manner in which you proceed
against me, nor that I refuse to recognise your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
assembly and your mode of procedure as not being
obligatory; nor am I subject to your laws nor to
your Queen. I cannot answer without prejudicing
my state, mine and the other kings and princes of
my rank. And at all times I am careful of my
honour, to defend which I would not spare my
life. Rather than do wrong to the other princes
and to my son I am ready to die, if so be that the
Queen has a bad opinion of me. She has been
wrongly informed if she thinks I have plotted
against her person. To show the goodwill I
bear her I have demonstrated many times in the
offers I have submitted to her, and by my
behaviour. In order that you should not think
I refuse to answer because I am guilty, and that
ambition has induced me to do a reproachable act
unworthy of my sacred person, I offer to answer
upon this point alone—the life of the Queen—of
which I swear to you I am entirely innocent. In
making this protestation I demand a deed in
writing.' They were very glad to have brought
her to this point, and said that they would not
trouble her with anything else. In order to
satisfy her and prove whether she was guilty or
not, they would receive her protestation and
hoped she would prepare herself to come into the
Council. She promised to do so immediately
after she had dined, with a little wine, feeling
herself feeble and ill.</p>

<p>They had erected at the east of the hall the
daïs of the Queen, and on the two sides along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
partition below were seated the Lords named in
the commission; and in the middle along tables
and benches were seated the commissioners and
Chief Justice in their order. Below they had
erected a barrier, one part of which could be
raised in order to pass out and in. Her Majesty
entered with a veil, a mantle, with a long train
held by one of her ladies. Beauregard was seated
in one of the chairs of crimson velvet at the side
of the daïs, under her feet a square of the same
material; assisted by Melville, Bourgoyne, Jervis,
Mowbray, and Beauregard, with Jane Kennedy
and Alice Curle, maids, behind her. None of the
other servants were allowed to be present. Paulet
and Stallenge were seated behind her as guards.
Bromley, the Chancellor, opened the proceedings,
and began to say that the Queen of England had
been informed, to her great regret, that the destruction
of her person and the overthrow of her
kingdom had almost been accomplished by the
Queen of Scots. Notwithstanding her tolerance
and patience, the Queen of Scots continued these
evil practices and had become the disturber of
religion and the public peace in her kingdom and
also in countries beyond the sea. The Queen of
England because of this had ordered this assembly
to investigate the same without malice. If the
Queen of Scots were guilty of this deed, and if the
Queen of England were careless or so ill-advised
as not to have it investigated, she would have
committed a great offence against God and would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
carry the sword in vain. Therefore she had sent
this commission, upon the reading of which and
hearing the things proposed by Council, the
Queen of Scots would be able to say what seemed
good for her defence and the declaring of her
innocence.</p>

<p>“Addressing the Queen of Scots, Bromley said:
'Madam, you have heard the reason why we are
here; you have heard the indictment, and you
will be able to say what pleases you.' She then
commenced boldly to make a speech, the substance
of which was that she had come into England in
the hope of succour and under the promise of aid
against her enemies; she protested that she was
a sovereign and free princess, not recognising any
superior but God; that whatever she did in
answering the commissioners, who she believed
were wrong and falsely informed against her, she
might do prejudice to herself, the princes her
allies, the King her son, or anyone who might
succeed her. Which protestation she made not
in regard to her life or to prevent anything becoming
known, but for the preservation of her
prerogative and honour and dignity, not wishing
because she appeared before the commissioners
to be compromised or declared a subject of the
Queen of England; but that she might show by
her answers that she was not guilty of the crime
against the person of Elizabeth with which she
was charged. And this point alone and no other
she would answer. She desired that each of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
them would keep this in remembrance, and that
her protest would be put into a public act, and
that all the Lords present and the nobility might
testify to it, all of whom she called to bear witness
if some day there should be need of it. And she
protested before the living God that she loved
the Queen her dear friend and sister, and that she
had always borne goodwill to the kingdom.</p>

<p>“The Chancellor in name of the commissioners
not at all approving of Mary's entering England
under the promise of Elizabeth, but disavowing it,
said that these protests were of no importance inasmuch
as the Queen of Scots was in the kingdom
and charged with such a crime whatever rank or
state she wears. She had become subject to the
laws notwithstanding the commissioners were
content without any approval or deliverance by
them. In the name of all present he protested
that the protestation of the Queen of Scots was
nothing and of no effect in law, and was in no
way prejudicial to the dignity and supreme power
of their Sovereign, the majesty of her kingdom,
or the prerogative of her crown. Which protestation
he required to be registered and all present
to bear witness to it. In the meantime they were
required to read the commission, which was in
Latin and contained the above.</p>

<p>“The Queen answered that she did not approve
this commission nor its constitution, being based
on new laws or articles newly made expressly
against her. Hearing the reading of a point she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
gave her answer without their asking whether it
was true or not. Their manner was only to keep
reading or speaking in order to persuade the
lords that the Queen was guilty. Addressing
always their speech to the lords was confusing
and without any order, nobody answering them a
word, so that the Queen told us when she returned
to her chamber that it put her in mind of the
passion of Jesus Christ, and that it seemed to her,
without making any comparison, that they did to
her in her place as the Jews did to Christ who
cried, 'Away with Him, crucify Him,' and that she
was certain there were those in the company who
had pity on her and did not say what they
thought.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding all this the Queen never lost
heart, and the more they warmed up to hinder
her the firmer she grew; her heart, her strength,
her reason rose to the occasion. She remonstrated
on the wrong Elizabeth had done her in
keeping her a prisoner. She had been kept
eighteen years in affliction, treated as the meanest
subject would not have been, having no
reason for doing this and still less a right; and
because of these trials she had lost her health and
the use of her limbs, as they could see; that she
could neither walk nor use her arms, and almost
always was in bed; had become aged and overwhelmed
with misery, and had lost the little gift
of <i>esprit</i> that God had given her; also her
memory to remember things she had seen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
read, which would have helped her in this place
when she was all alone; also the knowledge of
business which she had learned for the management
of her affairs, the exercise of the state to
which God had called her and of which they had
unjustly and traitorously deprived her, and so
hindered her from recovering her rights. Besides,
not content with this, her enemies by their
ill-will had tried to ruin her. She appealed to
Almighty God, her Church, and all Christian
princes, and to the Estates of this kingdom lawfully
assembled. She was ready and prepared to
sustain and defend her honour as an innocent
person provided they would give her a public
trial and in presence of some princes or foreign
judges, even her own proper judges, and all
without prejudice to their mother Church, to the
Kings, sovereign princes, and her son; specially
taking into consideration the right which the
English claimed, and pretended that it appeared
in their chronicles, that they were above the
predecessors of Her Majesty, the kings of
Scotland. This right she denied and would not
admit or strengthen by any act which she could
now do, being forced to maintain the honour of
these princes, and for want of this she would
declare them traitors or rebels, and rather than
approve she was ready to die for God and her
right. And in this cause being innocent she
would offer her life and give herself up to their
judgment, and thereby show that she was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
ambitious and would not undertake anything
against the Queen of England, nor did she desire
to reign; she had left all that, and no longer
cared for anything for herself but simply to pass
the rest of her life in peace and tranquillity of
mind; that her age and strength were not enough
for the burden of reigning, and she had no desire
for any government or public duty, seeing she was
in such poor health and possibly having only two
or three years to live. Also considering how
difficult it was to conduct herself and do justice,
and acquit herself with the dignity of a Queen in
these evil times filled with wickedness, the whole
earth being filled thereby.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Burghley</span>
interrupted her at the point which
concluded the last chapter, “not being able to
contain himself, reproaching her that she had
taken the name and arms of England and that
she had aspired to the crown. She said that
what she had done formerly in this respect was
by order of King Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span>, her father-in-law, he
knew well why; she said she did not wish to
give them up although there was peace between
them and King Henry. Although they had
made peace because it was to their advantage
she had not been inclined to give up her right
for their profit, to renounce it to the great loss of
herself and her successors without receiving anything
in return. She owed them nothing, was
not subject to them, nor was she their subject,
nor was she now to give up a thing of such great
consequence the memory of which would always
have been a dishonour and blame. Burghley
replied that since then she had always pretended
and aspired. She said she had never given up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
this right and never would, and begged him
before this assembly not to press her further; she
wished to offend nobody, and therefore hoped he
would be satisfied, for he and many of the
company knew well why these things had been
done, and there was no necessity to say more at
present. She knew well that her enemies and
those who had tried to nonsuit her had done
everything they could by all unlawful means, even
to attempting her life, as had been discovered in
certain places, by people whom she could name
if it were necessary. She did not ask for
vengeance, but would leave it to Him who was
the avenger of the innocent and of those who
suffer in his name, under whose will and power
she placed herself; she liked better the manner
of Esther than of Judith, although both were
approved by the Church, and she prayed God to
do with her according to his good pleasure, to
his honour and glory and the good of his
Church, as she had ever been brought up, and
for which, as she had already said, she would shed
the last drop of her blood. She was not afraid of
the threats of men; she was resolved to suffer and
endure all that God pleased; that she would never
deny Jesus Christ, knowing well that those who
deny Him in this world He will deny before His
father and disown them. As they read at intervals
letters of Babington to Her Majesty, and hers to
Babington, she denied flatly having ever seen
such letters or received them, so that she could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
not answer them. Upon this charge they insisted,
being that on which they founded all.
They produced cyphered and other letters and
the depositions of those who had been examined,
such as Nau and Curle, to prove that she had
received and answered this letter from Babington,
and in consequence consented to the murder of
Elizabeth. As to Ballard, who was one of the six
who had undertaken the murder, Her Majesty
said she had heard him spoken of, and had heard
from France that he was a man of good understanding
and zeal in religion, a rigid Catholic, who
wished to be of use to her; that he had much
intercourse with Walsingham, and that she
should beware of him; she knew nothing else
about him. Thereupon Walsingham got up and
stood with his head uncovered, and took up the
charge that Her Majesty had been warned that
he did not wish her well, that he had said much
against her and was her open enemy, even that
he had plotted against her life, hers and her son's.
He said he bore no ill-will to anyone; that he had
never attempted anyone's life, protesting that he
was a gentleman and a faithful servant of his
mistress. Her Majesty avowed that she never
thought this, and had never believed what they
said; that if he had not been received in Scotland
as he merited, she could not help it, and she did
not think he would wish to avenge himself upon
her who knew nothing about it. Of the four men
on horseback who were stationed in London to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
come and warn her when the blow should be
struck, she said she knew nothing whatever.
Her Majesty owned to some cyphers. There
were old ones and recent ones, but that was
nothing, as many of them served for different
occasions, and Morgan, who was formerly in her
service, was helped by these cyphers to the intercourse
he had with other princes. (This is the
first time she named Morgan.) They reproached
her that he was still her servant and that she
gave him a pension although she knew well that
he had plotted the death of Elizabeth with Pary
and was still a prisoner in France. He was
prosecuted and accused by Lord Derby, who was
a witness, at the request of the Queen. She
answered that they knew well she was not mixed
up in that enterprise nor had bribed anyone.
They could easily see that other people wished the
Queen of England harm; if anyone had plotted
against that Queen it was not her. She was very
sorry Morgan had been mixed up in such a thing,
but she was not responsible for his actions. She
could not do less than help him in recognition of
his services, which she could never forget.</p>

<p>“At last they changed the subject, after having
insisted for a long time that Morgan was a
pensioner, which she denied. She said she had
merely given him money for his requirements.
Of Nau and Curle they said they had writings
signed, that they owned to answers of certain
letters which they had always done by order of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Her Majesty; that they had written nothing without
communicating with her as was the custom,
not allowing anything to be produced unknown
to her, thus proving her direction of letters. They
were written afterwards in her cabinet, where
despatches were taken very often in her presence,
and after having written them they read them;
that she shut and sealed them always in her
cabinet, and they often wished to dissuade her
from these enterprises. She replied that she
could not answer as to Nau and Curle what they
had written about this enterprise. They had
done it of themselves and not communicated with
her; she entirely repudiated their evidence; that
Nau, a servant of the King of France, might have
undertaken something that she did not wish, and
that there was intercourse she knew nothing of.
Nau confessed publicly that he belonged to the
King of France and not to her, and only did for
her as he liked. They had many quarrels because
she would not give in to him and would not
instruct him; she knew well that Nau had many
peculiarities, which could not be said in public,
for which she was sorry, and further, that he did
her great harm. She did not wish to accuse Nau
and Curle; she saw quite well that what they
said was under fear of death, under the promise
of saving their lives, and that to do so they
accused her, thinking that she could save herself
better than they, never thinking that they would
require to treat her in this fashion. For more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
than twelve months Nau had written nothing
in her cabinet. He did everything, made out
his despatches in his own room, for his own convenience
and to be more at his ease, as Paulet
and all those in the house could testify. As to
Curle, if he had done anything he must have been
constrained by Nau, whom he was afraid of displeasing
and for quietness. At the same time
she did not think that either the one or the other
would have forgotten themselves so far. Being
for the greater part of the time ill, she could not
watch over everything and did not know much
that they did but left it to Nau.</p>

<p>“Burghley replied that Nau was owned by the
King of France as his subject, born in France;
that he had been Cardinal Lorraine's secretary,
but he was her sworn servant and did her
commands. He had not been constrained in any
way, but of his own free will had made this
deposition, sworn, signed, and written by his own
hand. Her Majesty replied that he was secretary
to the King, and called himself his treasurer in
this country; and upon this pretext he gave himself
airs and was often disobedient. She ordered
him in general and was answerable generally for
what he did, but she was not responsible for his
private actions, and would not believe that he
was not forced. Feeling himself feeble and
delicate, fearing torture, he thought to escape by
laying it on the Queen. A criminal is not received
on oath nor his affirmation believed; his oath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
is worth nothing. His first oath is to his master
which detracts from all others, which are no longer
of any value. She saw quite well that he had
neither signed nor written what they affirmed he
had. Then these shufflers in a rage debated
and fought over this speech of the Queen like
furies; all that had been said or written, all the
circumstances, suspicions, and conjectures—in
short, all the reasons they could imagine—were
put forward to make their case good and accuse
Her Majesty without her being able to answer
distinctly what they said; but like madmen they
went on, sometimes all together, sometimes one
after the other, in order to bring out the Queen
as guilty, which gave her occasion to make an
eloquent speech.</p>

<p>“Next morning after she had returned to the
hall, seated as usual, all the lords, who approached
bareheaded, listened with great attention.
She was permitted to speak freely, the
Chancellor having allowed it in name of the
assembly. She found it very strange the mode
of proceeding towards her, because having made
her come into this place against what was due
to her rank, they had given the management
of her cause to people whom they were not
accustomed to employ. Her Majesty was overwhelmed
by the importunity of lawyers and
advocates, who seemed to indulge in the technicalities
used by the petty lawyers of the towns
and the chicanery that they used, rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
confine themselves to the examination of this
question; and although it was promised that she
would be interrogated and examined on this point
alone concerning the person of Elizabeth, they
rather accused her and hindered her from answering,
and interrupted her, speaking and seeming
to debate among themselves as to who would
plead the best and distort the facts, wishing to
force her to answer about what there was no
question. She appealed against what had been
done and what was being done against her.</p>

<p>“Burghley said it was quite right she should
say what pleased her and what was in her power;
and that those who had spoken the preceding day
should have done what was necessary according
to their belief; that in order to know the truth
they made use of all their reasons which would
serve their cause. As to her demanding another
assembly to answer to, that might be provided,
but they had no power to do it. He would lead
them and cause them to speak or be silent as he
wished. Upon this we hoped they would not
continue long, because the greater part of the
lords had come to the assembly booted and
some in their riding habits. At the same time
we were in doubt as to what verdict they might
give before their departure.</p>

<p>“The next morning was employed in the
reading of letters as on the preceding day, for
the most part concerning the displacing of the
Queen of England by foreigners; the intercourse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
of Her Majesty with Christian princes, and her
deliverance from prison, all of which had been
already discussed. Her Majesty said if they
wished to deliver her from prison she was
willing, but she did not know the means by which
they might proceed; that her hands were tied,
she could do nothing. Many times she had
proposed an agreement for the utility and profit
of her kingdom. She had advanced these offers
so far that she had been suspected and blamed
by the Christian princes and in danger of excommunication,
having done more and offered
more than was approved of, and what in reality
was contrary to Catholic interests; that she had
often submitted on condition that they would
finish on their side what had been proposed, but
they refused her offers, so her submission was
conceded. She tried to do what she could for
the best, and appealed to Beale, Mildmay, Sir
Ralph Sadler, and the gentlemen of the Council,
as witnesses; also Somers, if he had been present.
All had to do with her affairs; she had often
warned them of what might happen, as she was
not responsible, and she had told them if anything
happened they would blame her; but foreseeing all
that, she had repudiated responsibility long ago.</p>

<p>“When the commissioners read, and wondered
at her confession of correspondence, she silenced
them by telling them it was not their business
to speak of the affairs of princes. Did they not
understand that princes had secret correspondents?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and it could not be otherwise. Burghley did not
blame her for this, and did not wish to enter into
it, but said if such a number of soldiers as was
spoken of had come into the country as the King
of Spain, the Pope, and M. Guise thought of
sending, what opinion would she have had of
them, and would she have been willing to answer
for the life of the King and the state of the
country; and would not the country have been
in danger of falling into the hands of foreigners?
She said she did not know what were their intentions,
but she was certain they might have done
something for her, and if she could have employed
them she could have formulated some agreement,
as she several times offered to do. They ought
not thus to reject her, and if they lost her they
would experience more harm than profit, and put
themselves in danger of what was being done by
foreigners. She knew nothing and wished for
nothing but her deliverance. Burghley again
told her that the death of the Queen and principal
lords and councillors had been plotted; that her
friends had talked of setting fire to Chartley and
killing her guards; they were to enter England
by all sides and harbours of the kingdom; that
all the Catholics were to rise, were to put Her
Majesty in place of Elizabeth; that they already
called her their Queen and their Sovereign, and
that the Pope had sent bulls to deliver the
kingdom from the illegitimate usurper; that they
made public prayers in Rome for Her Majesty as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
their legitimate Queen; that the King of Spain
and the Pope furnished ships, men, and money
to invade the kingdom; that already there had
been a revolt in Ireland which by the grace of
God their mistress had subdued, and had had a
victory over her enemies. This plot was to take
the King of Scotland and give him to foreigners
and Catholics in order to dispose of him afterwards,
and that Her Majesty had offered her
rights to the King of Spain. To all these things
he said she was a consenting party, as they found
by the letters discovered and read publicly, addressed
to Mendoza, Ambassador of Spain, to
Lord Paget, who was in Spain, to the Ambassador
of France in London, and others. Her Majesty
answered that she knew nothing of murder or
any attempt against the life of anyone or of a plot
or invasion of the kingdom; that as she had
already said, she had warned her friends that they
must take care lest they undertook some such
enterprise. They were doing something, she
knew not what; they had always hidden it from
her, knowing she would not consent, and they
were afraid of doing her harm; that they may
have made use of her name to authorise their
plan, to render it stronger, but that no letter was
found written with her own hand signed, nor could
they produce anyone who had seen or received it,
or had communicated or spoken with her. Besides,
they knew when she was in her kingdom
she had never molested anyone about their religion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
trying always to win by mildness and
clemency. It had been the cause of her ruin,
her subjects becoming proud and abusing the
good treatment she had given them. They complained
that they had not been so well as they
had been under her government. They were
formerly in the hands of a traitor and tyrant, the
Earl of Morton, who had tyrannised over them
till the very end. Since the death of Morton
they were scarcely any better, having been almost
always in subjection to the English, and others
who were traitors to their country. Of all that
the foreign princes had undertaken or done on
her behalf she washed her hands and had nothing
to say. As to Chartley, she said she knew
nothing; she had not heard of setting fire to it,
but they had promised to deliver her, and owned
that if the foreign princes had assembled it was
to take her out of prison, from which she could
not go without armed men to receive, defend, and
conduct her; and if the Catholics had offered
assistance, it was for their own interests. Being
so wickedly treated, vexed, and afflicted in this
kingdom, they had fallen into despair, wishing
rather to die than live longer under such persecution;
but so far as she was concerned, she knew
nothing of it. They would be none the better of
afflicting either them or her; she was only one
person, and although she were dead neither the
Catholics nor foreign princes would keep quiet if
the English did not cease their persecutions. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
regards taking the place of the Queen, the letters
they had read in this assembly answered sufficiently
for this if they would own it, because they
declared expressly that she desired neither honour
nor kingdom, and no schemes on her account.
She only cared for the Catholics and the kingdom
of God. She desired the deliverance of the
former and the defence of the latter. They did
not see that what they reproached her for was as
to her justification, and she proved the contrary
of what they laid to her charge, as was evident by
the letters. She could not hinder her friends from
sending her such letters as seemed good to them;
that they knew in their conscience what they had
done, but if they spoke as they wished, and desired
her to be delivered, she could not blame them;
and it was not for her to hinder them. It was
not for her to reform the Pope. She thanked
him and all Christian people, every nation and
Catholic assembly, for the prayers they offered
daily for her, and begged them to continue. As
to the bull, she had offered to hinder the execution
of it, and desired that the Pope should do nothing.
Upon which Burghley asked if she had really
power to do so; that in England they cared
nothing for it, and took no account of the Pope
or his doings. She asked them to cease persecuting
the Catholics, and she would do much to
appease the troubles into which they were in
danger of falling. Burghley said that no Catholic
had been punished for his religion, to which Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Majesty replied that in all places and every day
they were banished and exiled, fugitive and
wandering here and there to hide themselves,
and the prisons of England were full of them; in
short, they were made guilty of treason. Some
did not wish to serve or do the behests of the
Queen, being contrary and repugnant to their
religion; others of them would not recognise
the Queen as head of the Church. They had
been treated so cruelly that they died, and she
could see they wished her also to die by accusing
her of things of which she was entirely innocent
in order to make out what they had resolved. It
was no use troubling her further with these letters
and papers, as she would not answer them and
they were only wasting their time. It was not
for her to render an account of her affairs and
the correspondence she had had with Christian
princes. She was allied to them and had been
under their protection. Burghley said that if it
pleased her she could now retire, and they would
remain to finish the commission. She replied
that she declared herself a faithful and humble
servant of Almighty God, ready and willing to
obey his commands and those of his Catholic,
Apostolic, and Roman Church. It did not belong
to them to resist or blame what she did, as she
was guided by the Holy Spirit as God had
promised to her; that as she was given the title
of Queen they must not accuse her for that, since
it was not she who took it, but the Catholic Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
and the Christian princes who esteemed her
legitimate. They knew well that this was her
right, although they hid it, making special statutes
and laws to meet her case, showing that they
thought she could aspire to it, and that their
object was to dispossess her as a Catholic princess.
They must cease this procedure, for she had made
it sufficiently clear that she cared not for it herself,
but she would not allow it to be lost for those
who came after her. The troubles in Ireland
showed it was not for this that they revolted.
They knew well they were subject to her. That
country never had been peaceable, inasmuch as
they wished her for their Queen. A certain book
had been published in Ireland by Catholics desiring
that the right to the crown should be changed to
some other than her because they had little hope
that she would get out of prison. She was growing
old, sickly, and not likely to live long. As
to her son, he belonged to her and the Queen of
England, and she could do what seemed best to
her; she was sorry they had taken so much care
to make a league with him, separating the son
from the mother and assisting him against her,
and keeping him under the government of young
people like Gray, who had been a traitor, and
others who knew nothing about the government
of a kingdom, furnishing him with money and
making him Elizabeth's pensioner. He was ill-advised
to let himself be so subject to his enemies
on account of money received from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>
<p>Burghley answered that her son was not a
pensioner; that his mistress had given him some
money in order to get on with; that he had little
money, as it was given him to meet his engagements.
He said there was no mention of the
King of France in the league; that her son had
done well to enter into Elizabeth's friendship;
that they had always defended him, and Elizabeth
liked him, and they had not separated him from
his mother. Her Majesty said she knew well all
about it. As to the King of Spain, she had great
respect for him, and to tell the truth, she had found
nobody who had troubled her with such goodwill,
and he had often aided her in her affairs, and she
relied more on him than on anyone else. There
was also some talk of the Jesuits who had been in
Scotland troubling the State and religion, and of
a Dr. Loges, whom they called traitor, with whom
Her Majesty was in correspondence. She called
him reverend father, and he acknowledged her as
his lawful Sovereign. She said the Jesuits did
their office when they preached and laboured to
restore the Catholic Church. To counsel and
comfort afflicted Christians was their duty, and
she esteemed them good people. She protested
that she did not wish harm to any of the commissioners
for what they had said and done
against her, and there was not one of them to
whom she did not desire good, and apart, before
two or three Lords, she explained what they had
touched upon as to the deposition of her secretary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
She had some conversation with Walsingham in
private, who did not show that he remembered
much of what she had said. At last she told him
her cause was in the hands of God. And Her
Majesty, to gratify the commissioners, in passing
out of the hall turned to them and with a pleasant
mien said, 'You have behaved severely with
your charges, and have treated me pretty rudely
for a person who is not learned in the laws of
chicanery. May God pardon you and keep me
from having much to do with you.' They turning
to each other smiled, as did also Her Majesty.”
This was an extraordinary rebuke to the commissioners,
and it is unfortunate we have not a full
report of the trial, in order to see the treatment
the Queen so keenly resented, treatment that
must have been disgraceful to call forth such a
rebuke. The proceedings terminated, and the
commissioners returned to London.</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Babington to the Queen of Scots, July 1586:—</p>

<p>“May it please your gracious Majesty to admit
excuse of my long silence and discontinuance from
those dutiful offices intercepted upon the removal
of your royal person from the ancient place of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
your abode to the custody of a wicked Puritan
and mere Leicestrian, a mortal enemy both by
faith and faction to your Majesty and to the
Catholic estate. I held the hope of our country's
weal depending on the life of your Majesty to be
desperate, and therefore resolved to depart the
realm, determined to spend the remainder of my
life in such solitary manner as the miserable and
wretched state of my country doth require; only
expecting, according to the just judgment of God,
the present confusion thereof, which God for His
mercy's sake prevent. The which my purpose
being in execution, and standing upon my departure,
there was addressed to me from the parts
beyond the seas by one Ballard, a man of virtue and
learning, and of singular zeal in the Catholic cause
and your Majesty's service. This man informed
me of great preparations by the Christian princes,
your Majesty's allies, for the deliverance of our
country from the extreme and miserable state
wherein for a long time it hath remained; which,
when I understood, my special desire was to
advise by what means I might, with the regard
of my life and all my friends in general, do your
Majesty one day's good service. Whereupon,
according to the great care which these princes
have of the preservation and safe deliverance of
your Majesty's sacred person, I advised of means
and considered of circumstances accordingly, to
and with so many of the wisest and most trusty
so as with safety I might commend the secrecy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
thereof. I do find, by the assistance of the Lord
Jesus, assurance of good effect and much fruit
of our travail. These things are first to be
advised in this great and honourable action, upon
the issue of which dependeth not only the life of
your Majesty, which God long preserve to our
inestimable comfort, and to the salvation of
English souls and the lives of all actors therein,
but also the honour and weal of our country, far
more dear than our lives unto us, and the last
hope to recover the faith of our forefathers, and
to redeem ourselves from the servitude and
bondage which heretofore hath been imposed
upon us with the loss of many thousand souls.
First, for the assuring of invasions sufficient
strength on the invaders' part to arrive is
appointed, with a strong party at every place to
join with them and warrant their landing, the
deliverance of your Majesty, <i>the despatch of the
usurping competitor</i>. For the effecting of it all
may it please your Majesty to rely upon my
service. I protest before the Almighty, who hath
long miraculously preserved your royal person, no
doubt to some universal good, that what I have
said shall be performed or all our lives happily
lost in the execution thereof. Which vow all the
chief actors have taken solemnly, and are, upon
assurance by your Majesty to me, to receive the
blessed sacrament therefrom, either to prevail in
the Church's behalf and your Majesty's, or fortunately
to die for so honourable a cause. Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
forasmuch as delays are extremely dangerous, it
might please your Majesty by your wisdom to
direct us, and by your princely authority to enable
us and such as may advance the affairs; foreseeing
there is not any of the nobility at liberty assured
to your Majesty in this desperate service but
those unknown to us; and seeing it is very necessary
that some there should be to become heads
to lead the multitude who are disposed by nature
in this land to follow nobility; considering withal
it doth not only make the commons and country
to follow without contradiction, which is ever found
in equality, but also doth add great courage to the
leaders. For which necessary purposes I would
recommend some to your Majesty as are fittest in
my knowledge to be your lieutenants in the west
parts, in the north parts, South Wales and North
Wales, the counties of Lancaster, Derby, and
Stafford. In all which counties parties being
already made and fidelity taken in your Majesty's
name, I hold them as most assured and of
undoubted fidelity. Myself, with ten gentlemen
of quality and one hundred followers, will undertake
the delivery of your person from the hands
of your enemies; and <i>for the despatch of the
usurper, from obedience of whom, by the excommunication
of her, we are made free, there be six
noble gentlemen, all my private friends, who, for the
zeal they bear the Catholic cause and your Majesty's
service, will undertake the tragical execution</i>. It
followeth that, according to their infinite deserts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and your Majesty's bounty, their heroic attempts
may be honourably rewarded in them, if they
escape with life, or in their posterity; and that so
much by your Majesty's authority I may be able
to assure them. Now it remaineth only in your
Majesty's wisdom that it be reduced into method
<i>that your happy deliverance be first, for on that
dependeth the only good</i>, and that the other circumstances
concur—that the untimely end of the one
do not overthrow the rest, all which your Majesty's
wonderful experience and wisdom will dispose in
so good manner as I doubt not, through God's
good assistance, shall take deserved effect; for the
obtaining of which every one of us shall think his
life most happily spent. Upon the 12th day of
this month I will be at Lichfield, expecting your
Majesty's answers and letters, to execute what by
them shall be commanded.—Your Majesty's faithful
subject and sworn servant,</p>

</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Mary's alleged answer to Babington: Chartley,
17th July 1586:—</p>

<p>“According to the zeal and entire affection
which I have known in you towards the common
cause of religion, and since having always made
account of you as a principal and right worthy
member to be employed both in the one and in
the other, it hath been no less consolation unto me
to know your estate, as I have done by your last
letter, and to have further means to renew my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
intelligence with you, than I have felt griefs all
this while past to be without the same. I pray
you, therefore, to write unto me hereafter, so often
as you can, of all concurrents which you may
judge in any sort important to the good of mine
affairs, wherein I shall not fail to correspond, with
all the care and diligence possible. For divers
considerations, too long to be dealt with here, I
cannot but greatly praise and commend your common
desire to prevent in time the design of our
enemies for the extirpation of our religion out of
this realm with the ruin of us all; for I have long
ago showed to the foreign Catholic princes what
they have done against the King of Spain, and in
the time the Catholics here, remaining exposed to
all persecutions and cruelty, do daily diminish in
number, forces, means, and power, so as, if remedy
be not speedily provided, I fear not a little but
that they shall become altogether unable for ever
to rise again to receive any aid at all when it is
offered. Then, for my own part, I pray you
assure our principal friends that, albeit I had no
particular interest in this case, that all that I may
pretend unto being of no consideration to me in
respect of the public good of the State, I shall be
always ready and most willing to employ therein
my life, and all that I have or may look for in this
world. Now, to ground substantially this enterprise,
and to bring it to good success, you must
examine duly (1) what forces, as well on foot as on
horse, you may raise among you all, and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
captain you shall appoint for them in every shire,
in case a general cannot be had; (2) which towns,
ports, and havens you may assure yourselves, as
well as the north, west, and south, to receive
succour as well from the Low Countries, Spain,
and France, as from other parts; (3) what place
you esteem fittest and of most advantage to
assemble the principal company of your forces at
the same time, which would be compassed conform
to the proportion of your own; (4) for how long
pay and munition, and what ports are fittest for
their landing in this realm from the foresaid three
foreign countries; (5) what provision of moneys
and armour, in case you should want, you would
ask; (6) <i>by what means do the six gentlemen
deliberate to proceed</i>; (7) the manner of my
getting forth of this hotel—which points having
taken amongst you who are the principal actors,
and also as few in number as you can, the best
resolution in my opinion is that you impart the
same with all diligence to Mendoza, Ambassador
to the King of Spain in France, who, besides the
experience he hath of the estate on this side, I
may assure you will employ himself most willingly.
I shall not fail to write to him of the matter with
all the recommendations I can, as also I shall do
in any way that shall be needful. But you must
take choice men for managing the affair with
Mendoza and others out of the realm, of some
faithful and very secret both in wisdom and
personage, unto whom only you must commit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
yourselves, to the end things may be kept the
more secret, which, for your own security, I
commend to yourself. If your messenger bring
you back again sure promise and sufficient assurance
of the succours which you demand, then
thereafter (but not sooner, as it would be in vain)
take diligent order that all those on your part
make, secretly as they can, provision of armour,
fit horses, and ready money, wherewith to hold
themselves in readiness to march so soon as it
shall be signified to you by the chief and principal
of every shire, reserving to the principals the
knowledge of the ground of the enterprise. It
shall be enough at the beginning to give it out to
the rest that the said provisions are made only
for the fortifying of yourselves, in case of need,
against the Puritans of this realm, the principal
whereof, having the chief forces thereof in the
Low Countries, as you may let the report go
disguised, do seek the ruin and overthrow on
their return home of the Catholics, and to usurp
the crown, not only against me and all other
lawful pretenders thereto, but against their own
Queen that now is, if she will not altogether
submit herself to their government. These
pretexts may serve to found and establish among
all associations or confederations what is done
only for your preservation and defence, as well in
religion as lands, lives, and goods, against the
oppression and attempts of the said Puritans,
without directly giving or writing out anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
against the Queen, but rather showing yourselves
willing to maintain her and her lawful heirs after her,
not naming me. The affairs being thus prepared
and forces in readiness both within and without
the realm, then <i>shall it be time to set the gentlemen
on work, taking good order upon the accomplishment
of their design</i>. I may be suddenly transported
out of this place, and meet without tarrying
for the arrival of the foreign aid which thus must
be hastened with all diligence, <i>now for that there
can be no certain day appointed for the accomplishment
of the said gentlemen's design, to the end
others may be in readiness to take me from hence.
I would that the said gentlemen had always about
them, or at least at court, divers and sundry scout
men, furnished with good and speedy horses, as
soon as the design shall be executed, to come with
all diligence to advise me thereof, and those who shall
be appointed for my transporting; to the end that
immediately after they may be at the place of my
abode, before my keeper can have notice of the
execution of the said design, or at the least before he
can fortify himself within the house, or carry me
out of the same. It were necessary to despatch
two or three of the said advertisers by divers ways,
to the end if one be stayed the other may come
through; at the same instant were needful to
try to cut off the posts ordinary ways.</i></p>

<p>“This is the plot that I consider best for this
enterprise, and the order whereby we shall
conduct the same for our common security; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
stirring on this side before you be sure of sufficient
foreign forces, that were for nothing but to put ourselves
in danger of following the miserable fortune
of such as have heretofore laboured in the like
actions; and if you take me out of this place, be well
assured to set me in the midst of a good army, or
some very good strength, where I may safely stay
till the assembly of your forces and arrival of the
said foreign succours. <span class="smcap">It were sufficient cause
given to the Queen, in catching me again, to
enclose me in some hold, out of the which I
should never escape</span>, if she did use me no worse,
and to pursue with all extremity those who
assisted me, which would grieve me more than
all the unhappiness that would fall upon myself.
Earnestly as you can, look and take heed most
carefully and vigilantly, to compass and assure all
so well that shall be necessary for the effecting of
the said enterprise, as with the grace of God you
may bring the same to a happy end, remitting to
the judgment of your principal friends on this side
with whom you have to deal, therein to ordain
and conclude upon these points, which may serve
you for an overture of such propositions as you
shall amongst you find best; and to yourself in
particular I refer the gentlemen aforenamed, to be
assured of all that should be requisite for the entire
execution of their plans. I have their common
resolution to advise: in case the design do not
take hold, as may happen whether they will or
no, do not pursue my transport, and the execution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of the rest of the enterprise. But if the
mishap should fall out that you might not
come by me, being set in the Tower of London,
or in any other strength with strong guard, yet,
notwithstanding, delay not, for God's sake, to
proceed with the enterprise; for I shall at any
time die most contentedly, understanding of
your delivery out of the servitude wherein you
are holden as slaves. I shall endeavour, at the
same time that the work shall be in hand, to
make the Catholics of Scotland rise and put my
son in their hands, to the effect that from thence
our enemies may not prevail by any aid from
others. I would also that some stirring were in
Ireland, and that it were begun some time before
anything be done here, and then that the alarm
might arise thereby on the direct contrary side.
That the blow may come from your designs is
very pertinent; and therefore were it good to
send privately to the Earl of Arundel or some of
his brethren, and likewise to seek the young Earl
of Northumberland, if he be at liberty from over
the sea; the Earl of Westmoreland may be had,
whose hand and name you know may do much in
the north; also the Lord Paget, of good ability,
in some counties there. Both the one and the
other may be had, amongst whom secretly some
of the principal banished may return, if the enterprise
be once resolute. Lord Paget is now in
Spain, and may treat of all that by his brother
Charles, or directly by himself, what you commit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
unto him. Beware that none of your messengers
that you send forth of the realm carry any letters
upon themselves; but write their despatches, and
send them either after or before them by some
others. Take heed of spies and false brethren
that are amongst you, specially of some priests
already educated by your enemies for your
discovery; and in any case keep never a paper
about you that may in any sort do harm, for from
like errors has come the condemnation of all such
as have suffered heretofore, against whom otherwise
nothing could justly have been proved. Disclose
as little as you can of your names and
intentions to the French Ambassador in London;
for although he is a very honest gentleman, yet I
fear his master entertaineth a course far contrary
to our designs, which may induce him to discover
us, if he had any particular knowledge thereof.
All this while, I have tried to change and remove
from this house, and for answer the Castle of
Dudley only hath been named to serve the turn;
so as by appearance about the end of this summer
I may go thither. Therefore advise me, as soon
as I shall be there, what provision may be had for
my escape from thence. If I stay here there is but
one of three ways to be looked for: First, that at
a certain day appointed for my going abroad on
horseback, on the moors between this and Stafford,
where ordinarily you know but few people pass,
let fifty or sixty horsemen, well mounted and
armed, come to take me away, as they may easily,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
my keeper having with him but eighteen or
twenty horse, armed only with pistols. Secondly,
to come at midnight or soon after, and set fire to
the barns and stables, which you know are near
the house; and, whilst my guardian's servants
come forth to the fire, your company, having duly
on a mark whereby they may be known one from
another, some of you may surprise the house,
where I hope, with the few servants I have
around me, I shall be able to give your people
aid. Thirdly, some there be shall bring carts
hither early in the morning. These carts may be
so prepared that, being in the midst of the great
gate, the carts might fall down or overthrow;
that thereupon you might come suddenly and
make yourselves master of the house, and carry
me suddenly away; so you might easily do before
any number of soldiers who lodge in sundry places,
some half a mile and some a mile away, could
come to relieve. Whatever issue the matter
taketh, I do and shall think myself obliged, so
long as I live, towards you for the offers you
make to hazard yourself as you do for my
deliverance; and by any means that ever I may
have, I shall do my endeavour to recompense you
as you deserve. I have ordered a more complete
alphabet to be made for you, which you will herewith
receive. May the Almighty God protect
you.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">“After</span>
the departure of the commissioners,
Paulet treated the Queen courteously, provided
her with what was necessary to make her comfortable,
and gave her in addition the use of the
great hall which had served for the examination.
Her Majesty all this time, so far from being
troubled with what had passed, I had not seen
her so joyful nor so much at her ease for seven
years; only speaking of things for the purpose
of recreation, especially giving her opinion on
the chronicles of England, which she read daily;
and afterwards in chatting with her people
without any appearance of sadness, looking well
and appearing better than before her trouble.
Her resolution was that she did not fear to die
for such a good cause, and if anyone said they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
would not put her to death, she knew quite well
they would. She saw well that they were proceeding
in order to come to that point, for she
knew their ways of doing.</p>

<p>“In reply to Paulet, she said she had no occasion
to be indisposed or troubled; that she knew
in her conscience what she had done, and she
had already responded to everything; that God
knew she had never attempted nor consented
to conspire against the Queen of England;
that her conscience was free from all connivance
in that respect, and being innocent, she had
occasion rather to rejoice than be sad, having
confidence in God, the protector of the good
and the innocent. She was quite ready to
suffer death if it pleased Him. She had been
born in trouble, and the Queen her mother had
brought her up in trouble and had had much
pain in doing so; and at last was obliged to
send her to France, where she did not long
enjoy the good that came to her, the King her
husband having prematurely died. When she
returned to Scotland she was almost always
troubled, and had not been without trouble ever
since. It would be no profit to her to be afflicted
any longer. It was a great satisfaction to
have a clear conscience. Paulet said her
cause was not a question of religion, it was a
question of murder, rebellion, and invasion, and
being guilty, she ought not to deny it. If she
had committed so horrible a crime neither she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
nor a great part of the kingdom could be excused,
not even all the Catholics of the kingdom. If
they consented to this, they deserved to be
punished. She said they must find some other
cloak or pretext to enable them to come to the
point. She could see well what they had in
view, but she would have no worse cheer for
all that; they were not going to spare her.
Paulet said it was not for her religion; no one
had been punished for that. He knew nothing
of what the Lords had done, but they had found
the charge clear and evident. It was said they
had given sentence, that he knew not; some
supposed he had done it, but he knew nothing:
had only heard by hearsay. Her Majesty said
she knew they had condemned her <i>before they
came here</i>. What they had done here was only
to go through the formalities to make their
resolution feasible. She was not obliged to
acquiesce or submit, and she did not care in
the least what they had done. Having her a
prisoner, they could very easily afflict her and
kill her and dispose of her at their own will and
pleasure, for she was all along feeble and careworn,
and she desired that everyone should know
how her affairs were handled. Paulet said spitefully
that he was very sorry everybody knew it,
that such an enterprise was not secret, but he
had passed no judgment on it before the arrival
of the Lords. He said that Elizabeth should
not take the title of supreme head of the Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and that there was no head but Jesus Christ.
She replied that this was the only point on
which the exclusion of the Catholics had been
founded; that she thought this thing was so
common and so true that to Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> the
title had been given; that he might think the
Calvinists, who are the most reformed, did not
approve of this; but those who followed the
religion of the Queen, who are Lutherans and
inventors of this idea, hold everyone guilty of
treason or <i>lèse majesté</i> all who hold the
contrary. Not only have they judged guilty
those who would not recognise it or disavow it
by words, but they have obliged them to say
what they thought in their conscience, and upon
their answers condemned them to death. If
Elizabeth did not wish to accept this title she
knew well it was given to her and that they
were guilty who did not recognise it. Paulet
answered that Elizabeth could not do so, and they
did not give it to her but others, and those who
were called Puritans considered her governor
under God of things ecclesiastical and temporal
in England, but not supreme head of the Church.
There was no one that but Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>“At the conclusion we were of opinion that
he would write Her Majesty's answer to the
court. Her countenance was not in the least
changed, neither her conversation nor her actions,
and we said she could bear a thousand torments
sooner than ask pardon. She said they would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
instructed by Elizabeth, who wished to reserve
this authority in order to keep her under subjection
as incapable of the right to reign. She
repeated what she had been told several times,
that there were many others in England whom
they had put to death, princes, kings, and great
lords; as she said to Paulet some days before,
that England was the bloodiest of all nations,
and that they were in the habit from time immemorial
of putting their kings to death or deposing
them according to their will. Paulet said
it was of all nations the least addicted to that;
and she replied their chronicles were full of it.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>The next entry in the <i>Journal</i> is Sunday,
13th November. Drury, the Ambassador of
Elizabeth, came in the place of Stallenge, who
left next day.</p>

<p>“<i>Friday, 18th November.</i>—Lord Buckhurst
arrived in order to consult with Her Majesty.
He came with the governor of the castle to
speak to Paulet, then went back to sleep in the
town.</p>

<p>“<i>Sunday, 20th November.</i>—After having asked
permission to speak to Her Majesty they came
after dinner with Paulet and Drury into her
chamber. Lord Buckhurst had a message
from Elizabeth, if it would please her to listen:
that she, considering what had passed, had sent
Beale and him to tell her that after she had
been informed of rebellions in her kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
against her person and Estates, of which Her
Majesty was accused, knowing her rank and
having great regret in her heart that such a
thing should have happened, she had been
careful to order that the facts should be looked
into, and for that purpose had sent the greatest
and most honourable lords of her kingdom to
inquire into the same. They had reported to
Parliament that Her Majesty not only was consenting
to a thing so horrible, but was also author
and inventor of the same, and that she, being in
this country under the protection of the Queen
of England and the laws, was subject to the
same. After having deliberated with Parliament,
Elizabeth had given sentence of death against
her, and he had left his mistress irresolute, but
in order that she might not be taken by surprise,
there being such a ferment in Parliament, and she
was so importuned by her Estates, that it was
almost impossible for her not to consent. For
since the Queen of Scots had been in this country
there had been continual trouble in the kingdom,
so that neither the Queen's person, nor the State,
nor religion were secure. They all said for the
safety of these it was necessary that one or
the other should die, for it was impossible for
both to live at the same time.</p>

<p>“Beale and he had been sent to warn her of
her death, that she might not be taken unawares,
and they would send her the Bishop of Peterboro'
or a Dean to console her—these were men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
knowledge and reading; however, if she would
reflect, and recognise her fault, and make repentance
and satisfaction before God and man, and
if she knew something more of this plot besides
what had already been proved, she would unload
her conscience, as she was bound to do in Christian
charity, being a near relation of the Queen of
England, to whom she was indebted for the
benefits she had received. If she knew any
who were guilty in this matter, she should declare
it before her death, for such was her duty. Her
Majesty said she expected nothing else; they
were in the habit of proceeding thus to those
of her rank or those who were related or near
the Throne. They never allowed those to live
who could aspire to it, and that for a long time
she knew the end would be that they would
lead her there. She respected the Queen and
the country, and had done all she could for the
preservation of both. She did not fear death
and was quite resolute, and with a good heart
would endure it. She had in no way conspired
to the hurt of the Queen's person; her friends
had several times offered her deliverance, to which
for not having consented she had been blamed,
and they threatened to leave her and mix themselves
up no more in her affairs. In these
circumstances she had striven for deliverance
out of amiability, but to her great disadvantage;
in short, on being refused on the one side and
pressed on the other she had thrown herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
into the arms of her friends and had taken part
with the Christian princes and Catholics, not
for ambition or aspiring to great estate, but for
the honour of God and his Church, and to be
delivered from the misery and captivity in
which she was placed. She was not ignorant
that for a long time there were individuals who
had got up all these accusations against her;
and to speak plainly, it was Walsingham who
had confessed to being her enemy, which he
would never cease to be till he had accomplished
his purpose; of all which she had spoken before
the commissioners. Beale said that Walsingham
did not meddle more than the others, that he
was esteemed a good and faithful servant, and
that he believed that neither he nor any of the
lords had any special power to do anything for
or against her unless in the Council and Assembly.
Beale said that he had to tell Her Majesty
something about the treaties and affairs which
had been in the past in this kingdom, and with
these she had been connected and caused trouble.
He criticised her coming into the kingdom, and
said that the Queen had cared for her and
received and appeased her subjects who were
against her; that seeing her in danger, she had
helped her to retire to Carlisle in order to be
more secure. Her Majesty answered that she
had been led there compulsorily and against
her will. Beale said it was for her good, and
put her in mind that there had been affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
over which the subjects of Her Majesty and
her friends had taken arms. She said that
formerly when she desired to write she could;
and when it could profit the Queen and her it
was no longer permitted, but since her enemies
had procured her sentence she had not thought
it would profit or serve her in any way; besides,
being deprived of all dignity and title, she did
not see in what rank she could write for the
present. What she did was not to save her
life, nor to get pardon and escape, but only for
peace of mind and for a last adieu.</p>

<p>“Next day after dinner, Paulet and Drury
having been sent for, they came into her chamber,
when she made the same speech, adding that she
would make a rough draft of a letter before
them. And while they were talking Paulet said
he wished to read this letter before it was sealed,
as she might put something within of which he
wished to be assured because of his duty to his
mistress. On this they had some conversation,
Her Majesty being surprised that he should
require such a thing. At the same time she
said ironically that she thanked him for the good
opinion he had of her, to suspect her of putting
something into the letter that would hurt the
English Queen. Paulet apologising for his behaviour,
assured her that Elizabeth wished to
write her the same day (16th December). Her
Majesty's chaplain arrived.</p>

<p>“<i>Tuesday, 19th December</i> (the Vigil of St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Thomas).—Paulet and Drury were sent for
to receive her letter. She showed it to them
quite open, and took a copy of it, rubbing it
against her forehead, then shut it with white
silk and sealed it with Spanish wax.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>This letter has very fortunately been preserved,
though it is not in Bourgoyne's <i>Journal</i>, and is
in the following terms:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,—Having with difficulty obtained
leave from those to whom you have committed
me to open to you all I have on my heart, as
much for exonerating myself from any ill will or
desire of committing cruelty, or any act of enmity
against those with whom I am connected in
blood; as also kindly to communicate to you
what I thought would serve you as much for
your weal and preservation as for the maintenance
of the peace and repose of this isle,
which can only be injured if you reject my
advice. You will credit or disbelieve my discourse
as it seems best to you.</p>

<p>“I am resolved to strengthen myself in Christ
Jesus alone, who to those invoking him with a true
heart never fails in his justice and consolation,
especially to those who are bereft of all human
aid; such are under his holy protection; to him
be the glory. He has equalled my expectation,
having given me heart and strength <i>in spe contra
spem</i> (in hope against hope) to endure the unjust
calumnies, accusations, and condemnations (of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
those who have no such jurisdiction over me)
with a constant resolution to suffer death for
upholding the obedience and authority of the
Apostolical Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p>“Now since I have been on your part informed
of the sentence of your last meeting of
Parliament, Lord Buckhurst and Beale have
admonished me to prepare for the end of my
long and weary pilgrimage, I beg to return you
thanks on my part for these happy tidings, and
to entreat you to vouchsafe to me certain points
for the discharge of my conscience. But since
Sir Amias Paulet has informed me (though
falsely) that you had indulged me by having
restored to me my almoner and the money that
they had taken from me, and that the remainder
would follow; for all this I would willingly return
you thanks, and supplicate still further as a last
request, which I have thought for many reasons
I ought to ask of you alone, that you will accord
this ultimate grace for which I should not like to
be indebted to any other, since I have no hope
of finding aught but cruelty from the Puritans,
who are at this time, God knows wherefore,
the first in authority and the most bitter against
me.</p>

<p>“I will accuse no one: nay, I pardon with a
sincere heart everyone even as I desire everyone
may grant forgiveness to me, God the first. But
I know that you more than anyone ought to feel
at heart the honour or dishonour of your own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
blood, and that moreover of a Queen and the
daughter of a King.</p>

<p>“Thus, madam, for the sake of that Jesus to
whose name all powers bow, I require you to
ordain that when my enemies have slaked their
black thirst for my innocent blood, you will permit
my poor desolate servants altogether to carry
away my body to bury it in holy ground with
the other queens of France my predecessors,
especially near the late Queen my mother; having
this in recollection, that in Scotland the bodies of
the kings my predecessors have been outraged
and the churches profaned and abolished; and
that as I shall suffer in this country I shall not
be given place near the kings your predecessors,
who are mine as well as yours; for, according to
our religion, we think much of being interred in
holy ground. As they tell me that you will in
nothing force my conscience nor my religion, and
have even conceded me a priest, refuse me not
this, my last request, that you will permit free
sepulture to this body when the soul is separated,
which when united could never obtain liberty to
live in repose such as you would procure for
yourself—against which repose, before God I
speak, <i>I never aimed a blow</i>: but God will let
you see the truth of all after my death.</p>

<p>“And because I dread the tyranny of those to
whose power you have abandoned me, I entreat
you not to permit execution to be done on me
without your own knowledge, not for fear of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
torments which I am most ready to suffer, but on
account of the reports which will be raised concerning
my death unsuspected, and without other
witnesses than those who would inflict it, who I
am persuaded would be of very different qualities
from those parties whom I require (being my
servants) to stay spectators and with witnesses of
my end in the faith of our Sacrament of my
Saviour and in obedience to his Church. And
after all is over that they together may carry
away my poor body (as secretly as you please)
and speedily withdraw without taking with them
any of my goods except those which in dying I
may leave to them ... which are little enough
for their long and faithful services. One jewel
that I received of you I shall return to you with
my last words, or sooner if you please.</p>

<p>“Once more I supplicate you to permit me to
send a jewel and a last adieu to my son with
my dying benediction, for of my blessing he has
been deprived since you sent me his refusal to
enter into the treaty whence I was excluded by
his wicked Council; this last point I refer to your
favourable consideration and conscience as the
others; but I ask them in the name of Jesus
Christ, and in respect of our consanguinity, and
for the sake of King Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> your grandfather
and mine, and by the honour of the dignity we
both held and of our sex in common do I implore
you to grant these requests.</p>

<p>“As to the rest, I think you know that in your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
name they have taken down my daïs (canopy and
raised seat) but afterwards they owned to me
that it was not by your command but by the
intimation of some of your Privy Council. I
thank God that this wickedness came not from
you, and that it serves rather to vent their malice
than to afflict me, having made up my mind to
die. It is on account of this and some other
things that they debarred me from writing to
you, and after they had done all in their power
to degrade me from my rank they told me 'that
I was but a mere dead woman, incapable of
dignity'—God be praised for all.</p>

<p>“I would wish that all my papers were brought
to you without reserve, that at last it may be
manifest to you that the sole care of your safety
was not confined to those who are so prompt to
persecute me. If you will accord this my last
request, I would wish that you would write for
them, otherwise they do with them as they choose.
And, moreover, I wish that to this my last
request you will let me know your last reply.
To conclude, I pray God the just judge of his
mercy that He will enlighten you with His Holy
Spirit, and that He will give me His grace
to die in the perfect charity I am disposed to do
and to pardon all those who have caused or who
have co-operated in my death. Such will be my
last prayer to my end, which I esteem myself
happy will precede the persecution which I foresee
menaces this isle, where God is no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
seriously feared and revered, but vanity and
worldly policy rule and govern all—yet will I
accuse no one nor give way to presumption—yet
while abandoning this world and preparing myself
for a better, I must remind you that one day you
will have to answer for your charge, and for all
those whom you condemn, and that I desire that
my blood and my country may be remembered in
that time. For why? From the first days of
our capacity to comprehend our duties we ought
to bend our minds to make the things of this
world yield to those of eternity.</p>

<p>“Paulet afterwards troubled Her Majesty with
a rather violent speech, warning her to thank the
Queen and recognise the favour she had done
her not only since her arrival in England but
since, and in this last she was much indebted.
Her Majesty said if she had received any benefit
or favour from Elizabeth she thanked her for
it, but she did not see it, having kept her a
prisoner for eighteen years and then condemned
her to death. It was the worst that she could do.
Paulet said she had kept her from her enemies
and saved her life; that she had come into this
country fleeing from another place, and it was
the inconvenience of the sea that sent her into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
England. Her Majesty said there was nobody
in England who held this view but himself, and
that she had come into this country in a simple
fishing boat, which was not intended to carry her
farther, against the opinion of the lords who
were with her, of whom there were some still
living, who had tried to dissuade her from coming
because she would put herself into the hands of
the enemy and would only leave it at her death.
They would not cross with her unless she gave
them an attestation and certificate by her own
hand that it was against their will that she came
to England. Paulet, she said, showed himself
very ignorant of her affairs. If Elizabeth did not
wish to keep her promise she ought to have sent
her away and not detained her against her undertaking.
Paulet repeated it was for her good and
to save her from her enemies, therefore she ought
to have a good opinion of Elizabeth. Since she
came into the country and was under her protection,
Elizabeth had guarded her and done her
no harm, although she might have had suspicion
of her as a rival in the kingdom. She was quite
sure the enemies of the Queen of Scots would
have taken her life had she been sent back to
Scotland. Her Majesty replied that her subjects
had taken arms on the frontiers. Paulet reminded
her that when her party was the feeblest in her
country Elizabeth had kept her in her rank and
dignity, and her gratitude was to attempt
Elizabeth's life. The which was so undoubted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
that Elizabeth had a right to proceed against her
according to the laws of the country.</p>

<p>“Drury began to speak to Melville, and said
that many great lords had told him that the
King of Scotland had good reason to know and
respect the Queen of England, who had been to
him a good mother: that it was not the English
who had separated him from his mother, but it
was because he would not make a league in which
she (Mary) was included; thus they had treated
with him as King of Scotland, as one who
was recognised in England and in all foreign
countries. There was no other with whom to
treat but he who was recognised by the Parliaments
of England and Scotland. Her Majesty answered
on the first point that it must be allowed to pass
as above, she not having been allowed by the
Queen of England to arm her people. The
English not having laid down their arms they
burned and wasted the country, and she, being kept
by force, had not been able to make good conditions
for getting away. Her party would not
have been the weakest if the English had not
mixed themselves up in it. She was obliged to
tell them that one well-known man in England
(John Wood) had written to Moray that 'they had
not been able to keep the devil when they had
him in their possession.' Better to have kept him
tied and chained than to let her go. She desired
to be judged by her peers or by twelve subjects
not kings or primates, by whom England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
had no right to make laws. It was no great
honour to praise such a wicked man as Morton,
who was known for a tyrant and usurper, who
pillaged and ravaged all the wealth of the poor
subjects of Scotland, took her son prisoner, and
extorted money tyrannically from everyone. He
was a false man and a traitor, his life debauched
and vicious, coming to a climax in luxury and
adultery. Melville said he could corroborate this
statement. She wondered at Elizabeth thinking
herself a good mother to her son in having kept
him separate from her and hindered friendship with
his mother, having intercourse with those who kept
her prisoner, receiving her rebels and favouring
them. They ought not to have taken the counsel
of young Gray to treat with the son rather than
with the mother to whom the kingdom belonged,
and that as soon as he became King she declared
she had submitted by force, that she permitted him
to take the title of King provided he took her
counsel in affairs of importance and that he would
do nothing without her. Otherwise she would
disavow all that he did. The foreign kings recognised
him only on this condition. (Paulet was
evidently unable to reply.)</p>

<p>“<i>Thursday, 22nd December.</i>—Paulet sent to
fetch Melville and Bourgoyne both together, contrary
to his custom, inasmuch as Melville since his
return had always alone carried messages to and
from the Queen. Paulet declared he had something
to send to the Queen. This was two bags of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
papers according to what Her Majesty had asked in
order to arrange her accounts, saying that he did
not know what they were, but he gave them as he
got them, delivering to us aside a letter from
Curle to his sister saying that he had been allowed
to write to ask Her Majesty that as she had
promised for his bargain £4000 by testament and
£1000 in prison, it would be better to leave him
the 2000 crowns that he had had by deposit, that
the said sum might be put to interest in France,
as otherwise it might fall into the hands of his
enemies. As the bags were unsealed we showed
them to him. He said that because of his duty
and charge he had unsealed them in order to
know their contents. Her Majesty read Nau's
letter, which was in one of the bags in a very short
memorandum.</p>

<p>“<i>Friday, 23rd December.</i>—Her Majesty sent
to Melville and Bourgoyne to beg of Paulet to
tell the court that she could do nothing without
her papers which were awanting, and being those
that were principally required, namely, the conclusion
and clearing up of the past, and that he
would know what had become of them, as they
had been carried away by Wade. Desiring to
speak to him particularly of other points that
she wished him to write down, Paulet, who was
ill, promised to come to her when he was better,
but he would write to her upon this and other
subjects.</p>

<p>“<i>Saturday, 7th January 1587.</i>—Paulet sent by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
his secretary the papers which he said he had
received the day before from his servants, who
had returned from London with money for the
expenses of the house, as he thought. These
papers were memorandums made by Nau of the
accounts of the Queen for the years 1583-4-5,
what the treasurer had received and what he had
paid out, showing that they owed her more than
he had received because of the past troubles.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty complained that they were not
what she had asked, and were of no use to her;
that she must have her books and original papers
concerning her estate and private affairs, the which
neither affected the Queen nor England, and were
of no interest to anyone but herself. She wished
no writings to be in the hands of Nau. She
desired to know what she had to dispose of in her
will, without which she could do nothing, and she
wanted from Nau a memorandum of the money
he owed her in his own private name. This
money he had received from her and her servants,
including Pasquier, for the services he had given
her in furnishing stuffs and distributing them,
which stuffs he had paid with her money when he
was in London; while he also received it from
those to whom he had delivered the said stuffs
(paid twice).</p>

<p>“Paulet took a memorandum of this, to write
about it and about what Her Majesty wanted to
know more particularly. He said he would do it
when he could—he understood it well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Next day, 8th January</i>, Her Majesty desired
him to come and speak to her, as he had made
her understand, by his wife and Melville, because
of his malady he was unable. She knew he had
been out the day before, when she hoped to have
seen him, having also been able to walk out.
Paulet answered that he would come, when his
health would allow it—that he had a cold, and
could not stir. We were charged to tell him that
Her Majesty, not being able to communicate with
him, and having no answer to her letter written
nearly three weeks ago, thought of writing again.
Then when he was getting better, she would prepare
her letters, so that when he was cured he
might find them all ready. He, a little angry,
said she could write and prepare what she
wished.</p>

<p>“<i>Saturday, 14th January.</i>—Her Majesty sent
to Paulet to tell him that, according to what she
had sent on Sunday last, she was surprised that
she had received no answer, nor to that which she
had begged him to write. She wished to be kept
no longer in suspense, so as to arrange the
matters of her last will and prepare herself for
everything. Her letter was ready, and she desired
him to come and speak to her, and see the letter,
and seal it, as he had done the last. He being
in bed, with one of his arms bandaged, said it
was not possible for him to move or walk at
present. He was very sorry, but as soon as he
was able he would go to her. She gave orders to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
tell him if he could not come, to send Drury
or his wife, or both, in order to receive it and
seal it. Paulet said he would communicate with
Drury, and next day we would have the answer.
Which day, <i>15th January</i>, after dinner, Paulet
sent to tell us he had spoken with Drury, and
that he could send nothing to the court without
being authorised to do so. It was not for him to
hinder her writing, but he was a servant, and not
such an infant as to send anything without leave;
but he would write about it, and the distance not
being great, she would soon receive an answer.
Her Majesty sent to tell him she thought it very
strange he should act in this fashion, seeing she
had had permission to write; that they even
found it strange she had not done it, and that the
Queen of England expected it, and one single
letter from her might have kept them back, and
if she had received it they might not have come
here—that he himself, after the return of Lord
Buckhurst, had offered to do this, and had even
sent her letter. Paulet answered that he had a
commission, and that he had executed it, but she
might be content, she would soon have an answer.
Upon this he was told that Her Majesty wished
to know if he had instructions prohibiting him from
sending her letters. Paulet said he could not
answer particular questions: he promised to send
Elizabeth Curle's letter, in answer to that of her
brother, which she had received some days before,
provided he saw and read it first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Friday, 20th January 1587.</i>—Melville spoke
to Paulet about the diet and the ordinary pension,
if to have a servant, also our wages, to which he
received a courteous answer refusing a servant
but hoping he might be able to send the wages.
Upon which we founded our hopes that all was
not at the last extremity.</p>

<p>“<i>Saturday, 21st January.</i>—Paulet sent to
fetch Melville, Bourgoyne and Prean, upon which
we wondered much what it could be for, and the
latter not wishing to go because he had not
suitable dress, remained behind until Melville and
Bourgoyne spoke to him; when he refused, saying
he could do nothing without Prean. We concluded
that he sent for us in private suspecting
that they wished to separate him from the Queen.
Prean, dressed as he was, borrowed a cloak. All
the three having come to Paulet, he addressed
Bourgoyne, whom he requested wishing him to
tell the Queen that Melville and Prean were to
have no more communication with Her Majesty,
and he (Paulet) could not tell her himself. Then
Paulet said he had something to tell them that he
knew would not be agreeable to Her Majesty nor
to Melville, who was always known as a faithful
servant to his mistress, but there was no help for
it; that he must take it in good part, and know
there were good reasons for it; that they must leave
their mistress for the present, and they must appear
no more before her; therefore they must
retire to their rooms; that Prean, being lodged so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
near Her Majesty, they could not hinder him from
going to her. It would be better for him to live
in one of Melville's chambers; they were not to
be made prisoners nor lose anything they had
before, excepting in the presence of their mistress.
They could walk in the court, dine in the office if
they wished, communicate with the servants who
came to them, but not to enter into the hall.
Upon this Melville protested with regret, saying
that all his consolation was to be near his
mistress—would he permit him to see her and take
leave of her? Paulet answered that he could not,
and it was of no use; he said nothing to hinder
him from thinking that he might return to her as
before, but he must have patience for the present.
Prean, protesting his regret, said the same.
Bourgoyne, returning to Her Majesty, astonished
her and the others very much; they imagined all
kinds of things, but could not find a good reason.</p>

<p>“<i>Sunday, 22nd January 1587.</i>—Her Majesty
sent Bourgoyne to tell Paulet that on the report
that he had made she wished to speak to him
but it was too late, and she wished it to be taken
to him to think over it (I think she feared I would
be detained like the others). Bourgoyne said to
Paulet that Her Majesty found the manner of
proceeding towards her very strange: that she,
preparing for death, had wished to write to the
Queen, as had been allowed, even invited by
Buckhurst and Beale, and again allowed by him;
that she had given him a letter with the promise
and assurance to keep it safely, in which she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
treated of nothing which could hurt anyone,
neither of business, nor of things concerning the
country, nor the State, nor the person of the
Queen; that it was not even to obtain favour, nor
pardon, nor escape, having resolved to offer her
body and her life gratefully, and with great contentment,
for the cause of God and His Church,
for which she was ready to die and shed her
blood—not esteeming herself worthy to do this, as
she had many times protested; she had only
written about her <i>Will</i>, as much for her <i>Will</i> as
her funeral, which it was necessary to do in the
religion which she professed. She had received
no answer, at which she was not only astonished,
but she was not sure that the Queen had received
her letter; consequently she had prepared another,
but he had refused to send it; and although he had
promised to write to the Court, to see if she could
send the letter, which was ready, she did not yet
know if she could send it. He said he had
permission, and had sent the Queen's letter; that
it did not follow though he had permission once,
he had permission always. He assured her that
Elizabeth had received her letter, but he had
received no answer, and therefore could not give
her one. He would never presume to inquire
what the Queen had written—it was all one to
him, and he was not the man to keep back letters
if he had got them; and pressed to say if he had
been prohibited from allowing her to write,
answered that he had already said he had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
orders to send her letters. On the second point
he was told she was in great trouble to know the
reason why she was separated from her two
servants. The Queen of England had sent her
a priest to prepare her for death and give consolation,
and now, when it was more than ever
necessary, they had taken him away; that having
asked him to assist at her last end, when she was
nearest to her death, she was deprived of him.
There were none so criminal that they did not
give them a minister of their religion to conduct
them to execution and console them, and all the
consolation she now had in her affliction in
captivity came from her religion. She regretted
infinitely not to be able to make her prayers to
her contentment, assist at the Mass, and do the
duties of a good Christian. The Queen had
promised not to trouble her in her religion, and
said it was not for religion they accused her.
Her priest harmed no one, mingled in nothing but
saying the prayers; it would have been better
not to have offered his services than to take him
away in her great extremity. She could see that,
not content with afflicting her body, they tried if
that were possible to make her lose her soul,
which could not be. She had such hope in God,
that He would help her in this, as He had done
before. She saw that their intentions were to
take away her servants, one after the other; carry
her away secretly from here, to make her die at
their pleasure or murder her secretly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>“This she did not regret, as having no consolation
near her as she had hoped. She could do
nothing without her papers, and she required a
priest to assist and communicate with her. They
might leave her this consolation seeing they had
got everything they could desire as against the
greatest enemy that could be found. One could
do nothing more grievous than take away life.
The rest is not only cruelty, it is inhuman and is
denounced even by the wickedest of people. Paulet
said that he did not think Her Majesty wished to
have her priest near her, but he could assure her that
he was not far away. He was neither in France
nor in Scotland, nor out of the house; and he saw
no reason why she might not have him when
necessary. When he heard of Her Majesty being
massacred or killed secretly he indignantly protested
that there was no danger of such an outrage,
and they had no right to suspect him of such
a thing. Bourgoyne said there was no idea of
such a charge against him. Paulet said there was
no more danger for Her Majesty than for his wife,
his children, or himself. As for him, he was not
the man to do such an act, and was indignant that
he should be suspected of such a thing, for he was
an honest man and a gentleman. He would not
take such dishonour upon himself as to exercise
such cruelty or behave like a Turk. Upon which
they said that perhaps they did not mistrust him,
but there were many people in England who were
enemies of Her Majesty, and whom she suspected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
much, and whom she knew would spare nothing
to do her harm. It was principally those that she
feared. Then she complained that her steward
had been taken from her, and wanted to know the
reason; if he had done anything injurious to anyone
which might concern Elizabeth. They, without
her having asked him, had offered him to her.
He was of their own religion, and she did not think
he could have done them any harm. Paulet said
Melville was an honest man; that he was not
separated because he had offended Her Majesty
nor done anything on his own account, but there
were certain reasons, and it had to be done. At
last Bourgoyne said Her Majesty feared to send
anyone, as they might be detained one after the
other. Paulet said she must not anticipate that
as all her servants were in the house, and he
thought she need not vex herself about it.</p>

<p>“<i>Monday, 23rd January.</i>—Melville got leave
to speak to Paulet. Before this he had not been
allowed to do so, although he had asked for it.
We were full of suspicion and fear until the
evening of the same day about five p.m., when the
porter came to Her Majesty's chief baker to say
that he must not carry the rod before Her
Majesty's dinner. Upon which the Queen was
very much astonished and thought of sending to
ask the cause; but Paulet would receive nobody,
saying it was too late. Next day he would hear
them. If it was because he had prohibited the
carrying of the rod it would be useless, as it should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
have been prohibited when Melville was taken
away.</p>

<p>“<i>Tuesday, 24th January.</i>—Her Majesty sent
Bourgoyne to say to Paulet that she had so far
got over the fear about her life and murder
because of his disposition towards her. Having
been warned of his new prohibitions, she had come
back to the same doubt, as she could not but
think they were doing it with the intention of
taking away from her all conveniences and state
and dignity, the more easily to accomplish their
evil designs. She was much astonished that he
would forbid a thing of so little consequence, that
could neither hurt nor profit anyone. He could
prohibit her servants as he pleased from doing
her any honour, but he had been warned not to
prevent them from doing their duty, as they had
sworn to do, to Her Majesty's pleasure. He had
no authority over them, especially touching their
service. Paulet said Her Majesty did herself
great wrong, and did wrong to the Queen and
State of England, to the Council and to himself,
to suppose that they would undertake anything so
unworthy and so outrageous as to kill her either
by night or by day, stab or massacre her secretly
or suddenly. This touched him to the heart to
hear such a speech, and displeased him to think
that he could commit such an act of butchery, or
permit it to be done. They had talked enough
about that the day before; Her Majesty was a
woman of reason, of great mind, and practical, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
he wondered she would torment herself about this.
She knew they had taken away her daïs, her
steward, and her priest, and now she took offence
at a trifle, for having taken away the rod they
carried before her at meals. She was wrong, being
attainted and a convicted and condemned woman.
Bourgoyne said she had cause to be angry, seeing
they showed such ill-will for a thing of so little
consequence, and she remembered they had done
the same to King Richard, whom they had
degraded from all honour and dignity. He was
suddenly put to death, murdered in a moment,
and she feared the same thing might be done to
her. Immediately Paulet flew into a rage and
said they must not bring him such unworthy
messages, and that Bourgoyne had invented them.
Bourgoyne said he only repeated the Queen's
words, and neither added to them nor diminished
them. After much discussion they separated.</p>

<p>“<i>Friday, 3rd February.</i>—Melville asked to
speak to Paulet, but was refused. Paulet said if
he came on the part of the Queen, he could not
speak to him, being separated. If he came on his
own account, he could tell the porter. He also
refused to allow him to write, for the same reason.
Upon his wishing to know if he had offended his
mistress or Paulet, or why they kept him apart,
might he have his letters delivered to him, or
might he be allowed to return to Her Majesty, or
go back to his own country. It would be easier
to go to the kitchen to communicate with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Queen's women by the window of the hall, where
he might also see the Queen. He wished also to
be better lodged, being one of two in one chamber.
He was answered that he had offended no one; he
would have his letters in due time, and they would
see about his lodging; for the rest, nothing could
be changed.</p>

<p>“<i>Saturday, 4th February 1587.</i>—Her Majesty
sent Bourgoyne to say she was ill, and to beg
Paulet to allow him to go out and gather herbs
in some of the adjoining gardens. Paulet said
she would get everything she wished if she put
it in writing; and being pressed by Bourgoyne
to allow him to go, said he could not answer to
this, but must communicate with Drury, and on
Monday he would have his reply. Paulet being
pressed not to delay for fear Her Majesty might
get seriously ill, and it was necessary that the
remedy should be given her to-morrow. Immediately
after Bourgoyne left, Paulet sent to
say he could go if he wished, although he
thought it was imprudent. Bourgoyne and the
apothecary went to gather the herbs, and the
Queen began her cure next day.</p>

<p>“<i>Monday, 6th February.</i>—The Dean of Peterborough
and some others dined with Paulet.
After dinner, Beale arrived alone, consulted with
Paulet, and then returned to the village.</p>

<p>“<i>Tuesday, 7th February.</i>—Several arrived,
amongst whom was the Sheriff, as we thought;
after dinner the Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
at whose coming we were greatly astonished and
in great fear, having for three days imagined
all kinds of things as to Her Majesty's end,
fearing the blow was certain. They sent asking
an audience of her. She answered that she was
in bed, but if they were much pressed she would
get up if they gave her a little time. After
hearing that it was of great importance, she
prepared to receive them in her chamber, at
the foot of her bed, namely, the two earls, with
Beale, Paulet, and Drury (Shrewsbury with head
uncovered), together with the others, who did not
uncover all the time they spoke to her. Shrewsbury
began to say that Elizabeth had sent them
to tell her that after having acted honourably
in her affairs of which she was accused, and
found guilty and therefore condemned, he had
been sent by the Queen in order that she might
hear her sentence read. He, Kent, and Beale
had been commissioned to put it into execution.
Thereupon Beale commenced to read a writing
on parchment with the Great Seal of England
and yellow wax hanging therefrom, in which Her
Majesty was named “Marie Stuart, daughter of
James <span class="smcap">V.</span>, formerly called Queen of Scotland and
Dowager of France,” etc. This being read, Her
Majesty firmly, and without emotion, answered
that she thanked them for news so welcome; that
they did her a great benefit in retiring her from
this world, with which she was quite content
because of the misery she saw in it, being in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
continual affliction, and of no use or profit to
anyone. She had long expected this, and had
waited for it from day to day for eighteen years.
She was Queen born and Queen anointed, near
relation to the Queen of England, granddaughter
of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, and had had the honour to be
Queen of France. Throughout her life she had
only had misfortune, and she was very glad that
it had pleased God, by their means, to take her
away from so many troubles; she was ready and
willing to shed her blood in the cause of God,
her Saviour, her Creator, as also the Catholic
Church, for the maintenance of which she had
always done what was possible; loving the Queen
her good sister and the island as dearly as
herself, as she had often shown, having offered
in every way to take order, so that everything
should come to a good issue and be arranged
peacefully. She had always been rejected, thrust
back—held prisoner without having merited it,
having come of her own free will into the country
in hope of succour. With the Queen she was in
full agreement, and might have arranged everything
so that each would have been content if
she had been allowed an interview. And at
last Her Majesty swore on the Bible, which she
had near her, that she had neither sought nor
attempted the death of the Queen nor of any
other person. She was told by Shrewsbury and
Kent that this Bible was the version of the Pope,
and therefore it did not count. She was offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the Dean of Peterborough for her consolation, by
whom she could learn what was the true religion,
for her salvation. They said she had always
remained in what they taught her in her youth,
and that she had continued in that, because no
one had led her to know the truth; and now it
was time, when she had but a few hours to remain
in this world, that she should recognise the true
religion, and remain no longer in these follies
of popery and abomination; that they had the
true word of God; that she could make comparison
when she had spoken with the minister—she
could choose afterwards; that they spoke in a
good conscience, desiring that she should be right
at her death, and be converted to God. Her
Majesty said she had been a long time instructed
and well versed in her religion; she knew well
what she ought to know for her salvation and
conscience; she had not only read and heard the
wisest men of the Catholic religion, but also those
of the Protestant; she had communicated with
them and heard them preach, but had heard
nothing which could in the least turn her from
her first faith; that having come into this
country to the dwelling of Lord Shrewsbury, to
please everyone and show that she only acted
for her conscience, she had heard the ablest of
their preachers for a whole Lent. At last she
gave it up, which Lord Shrewsbury confirmed,
asking her to continue. She found no edification;
having lived till now in the true religion, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
not the time to change. Now she must remain
firm and constant, as she intended to do; and
rather than fail she would lose ten thousand lives,
if she had them, shed her blood, and endure the
tortures which they could inflict. Therefore, in
order to console her, would they let her see her
priest, to prepare her for death: it was all she
wished for. They told her that could not be; it
was against their conscience, which would accuse
them if they did so, knowing that it was against
God and their religion; that, as much as possible,
they should hinder and take away such abominations,
which offended God and their consciences;
but she would be allowed to see a minister.
Her Majesty said she would do nothing of the
kind, and would have nothing to do with him;
she wished neither to see nor hear him, and they
need not trouble themselves any more trying to
persuade her, for she saw they wished her to
lose both body and soul. She hoped God would
have mercy on her. She was already prepared,
and He who knew her heart would pardon her.
She was astonished that at the end they denied
those things which the Queen had granted her;
they had taken her priest, and when he became
more necessary they denied him to her, a thing
that was very cruel. It was told her that they
did not know who had granted her a priest, but
it would be a burden on their conscience if they
allowed him to come to her. And intermingled
with much conversation, it was told her as to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
condemnation that it was found she could not live
without danger to the life of the Queen and of
religion, and that of all those who were occupied
with her there was not one who could show the
contrary. She complaining of her son, they said
he had done his duty, and she must die in charity.
She said she pardoned everybody and accused
nobody, but in God's cause she could follow the
example of David: pray God to confound and
punish his enemies, and pardon her sins. At
last, being pressed to see the minister, she asked
when she must die; the answer was, to-morrow,
about eight o'clock in the morning. She again
asked for her priest, and said she could not make
her <i>Will</i>, not having received her papers, for
which she had written, and made Paulet write
that there was nothing which could be of any use
to Elizabeth. She wanted to arrange with her
treasurer, and not to disappoint her other servants.
They told her that Wade, who had them, was
in France. Then Her Majesty asked about her
burial. They told her she could not be buried in
France. As to her servants, they had no orders,
but they saw nothing that would hinder them
from doing as she desired, and have their gifts.
She asked where her servants were, and what
had become of Nau. They said they did not know.
She asked if she was to die, and he be saved. They
said they did not know, but he had not escaped.
Her Majesty said she would die for the life of
him who accused her and caused her death to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
save himself; then she was told she was no longer
in the hands of Paulet, but that the earls, from
now, would give her in charge to him, to deliver
her up when they came.</p>

<p>“Then the servants of Her Majesty, crying out
in tears, said the time was too short to arrange
her affairs—one night was not enough; she would
leave her servants destitute of all means, and to
have pity upon them; that it seemed by their
commission they had power to make the execution
when they would—would it please them to defer
it for a little time? The answer was that it could
not be so. Her Majesty sent for her servants
after supper, gave them a lecture on charity
between themselves, and took leave of them in a
long speech, giving them pardon for all, begged
of them to pray God for her, admonished each in
particular, requesting them to live in friendship
among themselves, and to give over all past
enmity and ill-will, showing how much reason,
wisdom, and constancy she had. Then she
parted her clothes among them, to each something,
as conveniently as she could. In the night,
after having slept some hours, she wrote her last
<i>Will</i>, as fully as she could, and for the little time
that she had gave orders for her movables, for
the journey of her servants, and distributed to
each some money, according to her will.</p>

<p>“In the morning, she admonished anew her
servants, and then remained in prayer until the
Sheriff arrived about nine o'clock, who led her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
away without allowing any of her servants to
follow her. At the foot of the steps she found
Melville, who took leave of her kneeling, who
showed how difficult such an adieu was to support,
and grieved that he must see such a spectacle
after being so long separated from her. Her
Majesty had asked the day before that Paulet
would allow Melville to come before her death.
At her earnest request they allowed Melville,
Bourgoyne, Jervis, Gourgon, Didier, Jane
Kennedy, and Elspeth Curle to be present, at
which, by the witness of all, she showed her great
and royal courage, her constancy, above all her
firmness to her religion and piety. After having
spoken some words to those of whom she had
spoken the day before to the lords, Her Majesty
refused flatly to hear the minister, who insisted.
She protested more zealously than ever, prayed
to God apart in Latin, while the Dean did so
according to his religion. After a few words Her
Majesty recommended her servants to the Lords,
and then gave them her benediction, prayed anew,
moving everyone to pity, until, standing up, she
made her two maids take off her veil, her mantle
with train, and her stomacher, begging of them
not to weep. Then anew she knelt down, holding
her hands to heaven, holding the crucifix of wood
which she had carried from her chamber, and did
not release it until the end; made her eyes be
bandaged by her maids, and without any other
bands raised her head and extended her neck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
which she kept quite rigid, and praying, waited
the blow without any movement. As long as she
could speak she repeated with a loud voice the
words, '<i>In manus tuus domine commendo</i>' ('Into
Thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit'), and
immediately her spirit passed away, and the
Queen of Scots was delivered from all her cares.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Bourgoyne adds nothing more. There can be
no doubt that the cruel and inhuman conduct of
Elizabeth, Walsingham, and Paulet, of which he
had been so long an eye-witness, had fairly overwhelmed
him with grief, and the last tragic scene
had prevented him adding another word. This
<i>Journal</i> can never be disregarded as a great
factor in the consideration of Mary's unfortunate
career, and particularly regarding her relations
with Elizabeth and her position in the Babington
Conspiracy.</p>


<p class="ac"><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></p>

<p>It is difficult to read this <i>Journal</i> without
emotion, more particularly when we think that
the Royal victim had committed no crime and
was absolutely innocent of any plot affecting the
life of the Queen of England. After the kidnapping
outrage her execution was clearly decided
upon in the mind of Elizabeth, and it would
have been better to have had the execution then
than to have tormented Mary for another six
months. No sooner was this outrage completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
than the first step towards the death of Mary
was taken, under date 13th September, as recorded
by Bourgoyne, when her personal servants, part of
her household, were separated from her by force,
and they never saw her again. On the 9th October
following the remainder were separated from her
in the same offensive way, and only her four maids
of honour were left to attend her.</p>

<p>Four days after this the commissioners arrived
from London to undertake the trial, which lasted
three days, a trial that was remarkable for its
illegal procedure:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) By refusing to permit the accused to be
defended by counsel.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Compelling the accused to defend herself.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Refusing to surrender to the accused her
own papers to enable her to make her defence;
which papers were surreptitiously seized by Elizabeth's
order some time previously.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) For having its decision “cut and dry”
before the trial took place.</p>

<p>These points have all been proved up to the
hilt. The trial was undoubtedly the greatest
farce in English history, and we think would
be very generally denounced by the English
people as an outrage on their national honour
and an event that materially affected the prestige
of their country. Had the vilest criminal been
sentenced to death he would have been treated
with indulgence and kindness up to his execution.
Not so Queen Mary. In the estimation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Elizabeth no amount of torture was too much
to administer, and she compelled it to be
administered. It is evident from the record that
Paulet had <i>carte blanche</i> after the sentence to
treat her with greater severity than ever.</p>

<p>On the 19th November she wished to send a
letter to Elizabeth respecting her will and arrangements
for her funeral, and on Paulet being asked
to forward it he replied that “he must first read
it before it was sealed, as she (Queen Mary)
might put something within of which he wished
to be assured because of his mistress.” On 19th
December Paulet was so insolent as to warn her
“that it was her duty to thank the Queen (Elizabeth)
for favours since her arrival in England and
since, as she was much indebted to her!” On 12th
January Paulet informed her that he could send no
letters of hers to the Court without being authorised
to do so. Mary wished to know if he had letters prohibiting
him from sending her letters, but he replied
that he could not answer particular questions;
and so the torture of the poor captive was carried
on from day to day.</p>

<p>On 20th January Paulet informed Sir Andrew
Melville that he must leave his mistress and
appear no more before her. Melville was the
master of her household, and probably her most
devoted and faithful friend and counsellor. The
separation of Melville was the greatest calamity
that could have befallen her. Thus they deprived
her of the services of her priest and also of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
steward, and on 23rd January Paulet's porter
informed her chief baker that he must no longer
carry the rod before dinner; the rod was an
emblem of royal dignity. Mary remonstrated
with Paulet, stating that it would neither hurt nor
profit anyone; but Paulet was immovable, and
Mary had to stand the insult.</p>

<p>On 4th February, four days before the execution,
Mary was ill, and her physician recommended herbs
from the garden to cure her trouble. It will scarcely
be credited that Paulet in a brutal manner refused
to allow the herbs to be gathered—but afterwards
he consented. All this persecution was by order
of the Queen of England. Why, it may naturally
be asked, was the Queen of Scots tortured in this
manner after she had been tried and condemned
and sentence of death pronounced? Surely her
condemnation might have satisfied Elizabeth
without resorting to those miserable tactics—cruelly
insulting her and killing her by inches.
Paulet, who was an uneducated man, was capable
of administering the coarsest treatment, in all
which he was supported by his mistress and
received from her many expressions of gratitude
for carrying out her wishes and keeping the
Queen of Scots in constant misery. We may
well ask, Was Elizabeth a woman, or was she
a fiend in human form?</p>

<p>On 7th February, the day before the execution,
the Earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, and Beale,
Drury, and Paulet, desired an interview with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
her, but she was ill and in bed. They, however,
insisted on seeing her, and were reluctantly
admitted, Shrewsbury being the only one who
had the common decency to uncover his head.
What these rude and uncultivated men, all foes
of hers, wanted was simply to read the death-sentence,
which, had they been gentlemen, any
two of them might have read the paper and the
others remained outside; or, considering their
errand, they might have had as much consideration
for the Queen as to wait till she got
up and dressed. This document showed the
cloven foot of Elizabeth. It described Mary as
“formerly Queen of Scotland and Dowager of
France,” which was an insulting reference; and
her crime was that she had attempted to
assassinate Elizabeth. When the paper was
read Mary swore on the Bible that she had
never sought, nor attempted to seek, the life of
Elizabeth. In place of receiving this in solemn
silence, seeing they had no authority to discuss
anything with her, they with incredible insolence
informed her that her Bible was the Pope's
version and not binding. They offered her the
Dean of Peterborough for consolation, “from whom
she would learn what was the true religion, that
she might no longer remain in the follies of
Papistry and abomination.” The offer she
rejected with scorn. On being informed that
she was to die the following morning, she
requested that her priest might help her to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
her will; also that she wished to be buried in
France. Both requests were refused, whether with
or without Elizabeth's knowledge is not recorded.
It was a disgraceful incident to all concerned.</p>

<p>And so we have arrived at the close of this
great tragedy, and the spirit of the Queen of
Scots has gone for ever beyond the jurisdiction
of its royal persecutor. Mary's reputation has
been dragged through the mire, and every effort
made by adverse critics to slander her fair fame,
but no authentic proof has been produced against
her, no proof that will stand investigation. Her
traducers have been compelled to fall back on
forged or fabricated documents, and these have
been freely put before us with the view of influencing
the public mind against her.</p>

<p>It is evident from the most careful research that
there is no authentic evidence to connect her
either with the Darnley murder, the Casket
Letters, or the Babington Conspiracy, while the
Bothwell marriage was by the Ainslie Bond
compulsory. Her life was full of trouble, and
her last days were made bitter by suffering
and distress. Can we wonder, after perusing
Bourgoyne's <i>Journal</i>, that Mary Stuart regarded
the scaffold with feelings of gratitude, and rejoiced
that her captivity was at last concluded?</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span>
are certain documents connected with the history
of Queen Mary, not easily found elsewhere, documents
which are of the very highest importance in estimating
her character and the adverse criticism to which she has
frequently been subjected. Specially we refer to her
attitude on the question of religion, a point that has given
rise to much controversy. No less than three proclamations
were issued by Queen Mary, all of which we
reproduce, and to which we direct the reader's attention.
Each of them is conspicuous for the liberality of her
opinions. It is evident from these that no attempt was ever
made by her to impose the Catholic religion on the nation.</p>

<p>The proclamation regarding Moray's Rebellion is a
document that is not usually included in the biographies
of Queen Mary. This proclamation was the result of
Moray and Morton's conduct in opposing to the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
last Mary's marriage with Darnley and taking steps to
create a rebellion in the kingdom. The Queen keenly
resented this conduct, and although her position and
influence were much stronger than that of the rebels,
these two nobles were vindictive, unforgiving, and
tyrannical to a degree. They both led the conspiracy
which resulted in Darnley's murder, and Morton was
the man who behaved so treasonably and disgracefully
at Carberry Hill and betrayed the Queen, an event
which was followed by all her troubles.</p>

<p>We also give the text of the two fabricated documents—the
Abdication and the Procuratory—signed by her at
Lochleven on 24th July 1567, when Lord Lindsay of
the Byres committed the outrage on the Queen by
forcing himself into her bedchamber and compelling
her to sign these papers under pain of death.</p>

<p>The letters in the handwriting of Phillips the spy, as
also the text of Queen Mary's Will, are reproduced as
being rather uncommon papers.</p>

<p>Queen Mary's Devices and Mottoes, which once
adorned her private apartments, have, very fortunately for
posterity, been carefully deposited in the State Paper
Office. They have been specially translated for this
volume, and must be admitted to be very ingenious and
very curious, and full of pathetic interest. The translation
was difficult on account of the age and obscurity
of the text; but in their new form they are an invaluable
addition to the history of the Queen.</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="smcap">Queen Mary and her First Parliament</span></p>

<p>Letter from Randolph to the Earl of Rutland 10th June
1563 at Edinburgh:—</p>

<p>“Her Grace has now held her Parliament, the solemnity
whereof hath been very great. On the 26th May her
Grace rode to the Parliament House in this order:—gentlemen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
barons, lords, and earls in their order; after
these the trumpeters and such other music as they had;
next the heralds; then the Earl of Moray, who carried
the sword, the Earl of Argyll the sceptre, and the Duke
the regalia. Then followed the Queen in her Parliament
robes and a very fair rich crown upon her head. There
followed Her Grace the noblemen's wives as these were
in dignity, twelve in number; after them the four Maries,
demoiselles of honour, or the Queen's minions, call
them as pleases your honour, but a fairer sight was
never seen. These being the principals, sixteen, there
followed them as many more so wonderful in beauty
that I know not what court may be compared to them.
The choice, I assure your lordship, that day was there
of the whole realm. Having taken her place in Parliament,
and silence being commanded, the Queen delivered,
with a singular good grace, an oration short and very
pretty, of which I send your lordship a copy. I am
sure she made it herself, and she deserved great praise
for delivering the same. I had that day the honour to
escort Her Grace to the Parliament House and to be
present at the whole solemnities during the time she
was there. That day there was little done.”</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="smcap">Queen Mary's Proclamation anent Religion,<br />
Edinburgh</span>, <i>25th August 1561</i></p>

<p>“Forasmuch as the Queen's Majesty has understood
the great inconvenience that may come by the division
presently standing in this realm in matters of religion,
that Her Majesty is desirous to see pacified by an order
to the honour of God and tranquillity of her realm, and
means to adopt the same by the advice of her Estates
as soon as convenient may be. Her Majesty's resolution
may be greatly hindered if any tumult or sedition be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
raised among the lieges. Therefore Her Majesty ordains
letters to be directed charging all and sundry by open
proclamation at the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh and
other places, that the lieges continue in quietness, keep
peace and civil society among themselves. In the meantime
while the Estates of her realm may be assembled,
and Her Majesty having taken a final order by their
advice and consent, which Her Majesty hopes will be for
the good of all—that none of them take on themselves
publicly or privately to make any alteration or innovation
on the state of religion, or attempt anything against the
form which Her Majesty found universally observed on
her arrival in this realm, under pain of death; with
certification that if any subject violate this order he shall
be held to be a seditious person and a raiser of tumult,
and the said penalty shall be executed upon him with
all rigour, as an example to others,—Her Majesty by
the advice of the Lords of her Secret Council commands
and charges her lieges that none of them take upon
themselves to molest or trouble any of her domestic
servants or any person who has come from France in
her company, in word, deed, or countenance, or any
cause whatever, either within her palace or outside of it,
or make any division amongst them on any colour or
pretence, under pain of death. Albeit Her Majesty is
sufficiently persuaded that her good and loving subjects
would do the same for the reverence they bear to her
person and authority even if no such command were
published.”</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="smcap">Second Proclamation,<br />
St. Andrews</span>, <i>16th March 1562</i></p>
<p>“Forasmuch as our Sovereign Lady remembering that
soon after her arrival in this realm, understanding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
great inconvenience that might follow by the differences
in matters of religion, and being desirous to see the
same pacified by a good order to the honour of God
and tranquillity of the realm, directed letters, proclamations,
and charges throughout the realm, straightly
commanding her lieges that they should continue in
quietness and keep peace and civil society among themselves.
In the meantime the Estates might be assembled
and a final order by their advice and consent might be
taken in the matter that none of the lieges shall take in
hand privately or openly to make any alteration on the
state of religion, or attempt anything against the form
which Her Majesty found publicly and universally
observed on her arrival, under pain of death. With
certification that if any violate this order he shall be
held to be a seditious person and a raiser of tumult.
Albeit the same was duly proclaimed so that none can
pretend ignorance thereof. Nevertheless, some forgetting
their duty, are reported to have contravened, and intend
purposely to contravene, the same by innovation of the
religion and ministration of the sacraments otherwise
than the public form aforesaid. Such contravention if
it be allowed to proceed unpunished may not only
engender contempt for our authority, but raise tumult
and sedition within the realm, to the hindrance of Her
Majesty's good intentions for restoring peace in such

<p>“The King and Queen remembering that soon after
Her Majesty's arrival great inconvenience arose by differences
in matters of religion, and being desirous to see
the same pacified, directed letters, proclamations, and
charges throughout the realm, commanding the lieges
not to make any alteration on the state of religion or
attempt anything against the form which Her Majesty
found prevailing on her arrival, under pain of death;
with certification that if any should act contrary to this
he should be regarded as a seditious person and raiser
of tumult. The same has been divers times duly
proclaimed, so that none can pretend ignorance. Nevertheless,
some forgetting their duty, it is reported that
they have contravened, and intend to contravene, the
same by introducing the religion and ministration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
the sacraments otherwise than by the public form
observed on Her Majesty's arrival. Others have already
disobeyed their Majesties' commands and are denounced
rebels and put to the horn. To cover their rebellion
they endeavour to persuade the lieges to believe that
their Majesties in prosecuting the rebels mean nothing
else but the plain subversion of the state of religion as
aforesaid. By such false reports they alienate the lieges
from their loyalty. For eschewing of which false report
their Majesties ordain letters to be directed to officers of
the King and Queen, etc., charging all and sundry their
lieges that they endeavour to observe and obey the
former proclamation, and that none presume to attempt
anything that may tend to the violation and breaking
thereof under the penalty contained in the same.”</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="smcap">Proclamation Touching Moray's
  Rebellion</span></p>

<p>Declaration by the King and Queen, 3rd September
1565:—</p>

<p>“Forasmuch as in this uproar lately raised against
us by certain rebels and others to blind the eyes of the
simple people, we have given them to understand that
the quarrel they had in hand was only religion, thinking
with that cloak to cover their other ungodly designs.
And so under pretence of that plausible argument to
draw after them a large following of ignorant persons.
Now, for preservation of our lieges whose cases were
to be pitied if they blindly should be trapped in so
dangerous a snare, it has pleased God, by the utterance
of their own mouths and writings to us, to discover the
poison that before lay hid in their hearts; albeit to
persons of clear judgment the same was evident before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
For what other thing might move the principal raisers
of this tumult to put themselves in arms against us so
unnaturally, upon whom we had bestowed so many
benefits. The great honour we did to them, being
thereof most unworthy, made them to misknow themselves,
and their insatiable ambition could not be
satisfied with heaping riches upon riches, and honour
upon honour, unless they might receive in their hands
ourselves and our whole realm, to be led, used, and disposed
at their pleasure. But of this the multitude
could not perceive if God, for disclosing of their
hypocrisy, had not compelled them to utter their unreasonable
desire to govern. For now, by letters sent
from themselves to us, they make plain confession that
the establishing religion will not content them, but we
must perforce be governed by such counsel as shall
please them to give us, a thing so far beyond all reason
that we think the mere mention of such a demand is
sufficient to make their nearest kinsfolk their mortal
enemies. What is this but in a manner to invert the
order of nature, to make the prince obey, the subject
to command? The like was never demanded of any of
our noble progenitors, nor of governors or regents. The
princes ever chose their counsel of such as they thought
most fit. When we ourselves were of less age, and on
our first arrival in the realm, we had free choice of
counsel at our pleasure. Now, when we are at our full
majority, shall we be brought back to the state of
pupilage and minority, or be put under tutelage?</p>

<p>“So long as some of them bore the whole swing with
us, this matter was never called in question; but now,
when they cannot be permitted to do and undo all
things at their own pleasure, they will put a bridle on
our mouths and give us counsel after their own fantasy.
This is the quarrel of religion they made you believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
they had in hand; this is the quarrel for which they
would have you hazard your lives, lands, and goods, in
company with certain rebels against your natural
princes; or, in plain language, they would be kings
themselves, leaving us the bare name and title, taking
to themselves the whole use and administration of the
kingdom.</p>

<p>“We have thought good to make publication hereof
so that you suffer not yourselves to be deceived under
pretence of religion to follow them, who, preferring their
own advancement to the public good, would, if ye
hearken to their voice, draw you after them to your
utter destruction. Assuring you that as we have
hitherto had good experience of our clemency, and
under our rule enjoyed in peace the possession of your
goods and liberty of conscience, so may ye be in full
assurance of the like hereafter, and have us always
your good and loving princess as many as shall continue
in due obedience and do the office of faithful and
natural subjects.</p>

these our letters shall come, greeting:—Forasmuch as
after long, great, and intolerable pains and labours taken
by us since our arrival in the realm for the government
thereof, and keeping of the lieges in quietness, we have
not only been vexed in our spirit, body, and senses, but
altogether so wearied thereof, that our ability and

Therefore and because nothing earthly can be more
comfortable and happy to us, or in our lifetime to see
our most dear son the native prince of this our realm,
placed in the kingdom thereof, and the crown royal set
on his head; we of our own free will and special motive
have demitted and renounced the government, guiding,
and governing of this our realm of Scotland, lieges, and
subjects thereof, in favour of our said son; to the effect
that in all time coming he may peaceably and quietly
enjoy the same without trouble and be obeyed as native
king and prince of the same by the lieges thereof.
And understanding by reason of his youth he is not
able in his own person to administer in his kingly
government as equity requires until hereafter he come
to the years of discretion; and also knowing the
proximity of blood standing between our son and
our dearest brother James, Earl of Bothwell, Lord
Abernethy, etc., and having experience of the natural
affection and kindly love he has in all times borne and
presently bears towards us, honour and estate of our

joy, nor felicity on earth can come than to see him
inaugurated in his kingdom, feared, reverenced, and

privileges, honours, and other immunities that appertain
to the office of a king, as well in governing his realm
and people according to the laws, as in repressing the
violence of such as would invade or unjustly resist him,
or their or his royal authority; with power to our

authority, and on behalf of our said most dearest son,
to receive surrenders of whatever lands are holden of
him, or of offices, castles, towers, fortalices, fishings,

  Schemes for Queen Mary's liberation from the grasp
of Elizabeth, with a portion of the Correspondence
which followed thereon</span></p>

<p>In May, June, and July 1586, no less than three
plots for Mary's liberation were proposed by the
Catholics—one by John Savage for the assassination
of Elizabeth and release of Mary; one by Ballard for
an invasion of England and release of Mary; and one
by Babington for her release by force of arms. These
plots eventually culminated in one scheme, and
Walsingham, by the aid of his spies, was able to
intercept letters, decipher and copy them, introduce
matter of his own into the copies, and by this means
brought about the ruin of all concerned, including Mary
herself. The Babington plot<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> we have fully recited,
but we now reproduce the following letters translated
from the French, not hitherto published by us,
excepting Nos. 3 and 4. They throw a very curious
light over the startling events of these three months.
The letters are No. 1, Queen Mary to Charles Paget;
No. 2, Charles Paget to Queen Mary; No. 3, Babington
to Queen Mary; No. 4, Mary to Babington; No. 5,
Mary to Paget; No. 6, Mary to Mendoza, the Spanish
Ambassador.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>These letters are preserved in the State Paper Office
in the handwriting of Phillips, one of the spies, and this
throws suspicion on the whole. We cannot guarantee
that any one of them is genuine, and it will be well for
the reader to attach little importance to them; but as
an illustration of the voluminous literature of that
period, they will be read with interest. It was very
probably these interpolated letters that gave rise to
the kidnapping plot of 16th August. A writer in our
own day (Strickland) says: “The tone in which Queen
Mary writes on 13th July to Archbishop Beton shows
that she was perfectly unconscious that any projects
against Elizabeth's life were in contemplation; in the
mass of papers seized at Chartley it is a striking fact
that not one was produced in evidence against her.”</p>

<p>Queen Mary to Charles Paget, 20th May 1586:—</p>

<p>“I have thought it good that you enter with the
ambassador of Spain into the following overtures:—That
I endeavour by all means to make my son enter
into the enterprise (invasion of England), and if he
does not, that I arrange a secret league among the
Catholic nobility and adherents to be joined with the
King of Spain, to do what shall be thought meet for
advancing the scheme, so being that they have plenty
of men and money. Moreover, I shall arrange to have
my son delivered into the hands of the King of Spain
or the Pope, as shall be thought best, stipulating to set
him at liberty when I shall desire, or that after my
death, being Catholic, he shall desire to return to
Scotland; and that the King of Spain shall never
attempt anything to my prejudice or my son's (if he
be Catholic) in the succession to the Crown. This is
the best hostage that I and the Lords of Scotland can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
give to the said king for the performance of that which
depends on them in this enterprise, but withal there
must be a regent appointed in Scotland having commission
from me and my son to govern the country
in his absence, and I find no man so capable as Lord
Claud Hamilton. He shall have a Privy Council, without
which he shall not ordain anything of importance.
I shall be obliged to the King of Spain if he will
receive my son and instruct him in the Catholic
religion, which is the thing of all things in this world
I most desire, affecting rather the salvation of his soul,
than to see him monarch of all Europe. And I fear
much that so long as he remains where he is it will
never be in my power to bring him again into the
right ways, whereby there shall remain in my heart a
thousand regrets if I should die and leave behind me a
tyrant and persecutor of the Catholic Church. If you
get a good answer from the ambassador, I would desire
you to write Lord Claud informing him that the King
of Spain is to set on this country (invasion of England),
and desires to have the assistance of the Catholics of
Scotland to stop any assistance that may come from
there to the Queen of England. You will also inquire
what help in men and money would be required from
the said king to hold Scotland. If you get a favourable
answer, you may inform Lord Claud that to assure
himself of my son, if all things be done under his name
and authority, it shall be necessary to seize his person
if he cannot be willingly brought into this enterprise,
and that the surest way would be to deliver him to the
said king or the Pope, as shall be deemed best, Lord
Claud to be regent in his absence.</p>

<p>“All this I will confirm and approve. For various
reasons my name not to be named in this until the
very last. You will say to Lord Claud, that indirectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
you put him in hope that I shall make him be declared
lawful heir to the Crown of Scotland should my son
die without children, and that I shall make the Catholic
princes of Christendom recognise and maintain him.
I have written to the Spanish Ambassador in favour of
your brother Lord Paget and yourself.

<hr class="small" />

<p>Charles Paget to Queen Mary, 29th May 1586:—</p>

<p>“Since my last letter to your Majesty, a priest named
Ballard, capable and discreet, has arrived who knows
the most important Catholics in England and Scotland.
He has been sent by them to announce this resolution
to take up arms, provided they are assured of foreign
assistance. I sent him to the Spanish Ambassador
that he might report what he knew, and to state how
many of the chief nobles and knights in the North and
West country were ready to take up arms; what number
of men, armed and unarmed, and how many of them had
promised and therefore received the sacrament in order
to make their obligation stronger; as now the Earl of
Leicester has with him the best and most valiant
captains and Protestant soldiers; and the people are
annoyed and discontented at the oppression they have
endured on account of the wars in the Netherlands.
These times are more suitable than ever to accomplish
with little trouble the deliverance of the Queen.</p>

<p>“The ambassador listened attentively, and requested
Ballard to write down full details of the numbers from
these provinces who would take up arms on Mary's
behalf. Ballard said he could not name the persons, as
he had pledged his word to the priest not to do so.
The ambassador gave notice of the ports for landing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
and several other things which he thought the knowledge
of would be necessary. Nevertheless he (Ballard) came
with a resolution so general that the ambassador gave
him other instructions to show him how to proceed,
more particularly and by secret means assuring him
that the King of Spain, after being fully satisfied, would
give them prompt assistance. The principal thing with
which he is charged is to assure and guarantee your
person, and if strong enough to try by every possible
means to carry off your Majesty from the hands of those
who restrain you. After this we consulted about the best
port for landing troops. I think Newcastle, Hartlepool,
or Scarborough, or some other port in the north; our
help will be by the Prince of Parma. Our design will
not be suspected by the Queen of England, as she would
never dream of enemies this way (the East coast); she
believing that all designs would come by way of Spain.
Ballard will be here again immediately after my return
from the baths, and you will be promptly informed of
everything that happens.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Queen Mary to Charles Paget, 27th July 1586:—</p>

<p>“Upon the return of Ballard to this country, one of
the principal Catholics who sent him (to the Queen)
communicated their intentions according to what you
had written before, more particularly asking directions
for the execution of the design. I have written them a
full despatch, giving my advice concerning all requirements;
as much for those on this side as for those outside
the kingdom, in order to bring their enterprise
to a successful issue. I have shown them that they
must not lose time, having undertaken to carry out the
resolution contained in the despatch, they must hasten to
communicate this to Mendoza, the Spanish Ambassador,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
sending for the purpose either Ballard or some other of
the most faithful and secret that can be found, and who
will be sufficiently instructed by them, having promised
them that I would write to Mendoza as I do now, to
give credit to these messengers, the Stewards: so that
I hope if ever the Pope or the King of Spain have had
intentions to provide aid to this state, the occasion is
now offered them very advantageously. Finding that
the Catholics are so well prepared there will be more to
do to keep them back than to urge them forward. As
to the other difficulties that the ambassador refers to,
such as my escape from here and other things, he will
be sufficiently satisfied. It only remains now to go on
as quickly as possible, both in Rome and Spain, to procure
the required support in horses, foot-soldiers, arms,
ammunition, and money.”</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>Queen Mary to Mendoza, the Spanish Ambassador,
Chartley, 27th July 1586:—</p>

<p>“Since yours of the 29th May I have been pleased to
see that my good brother the King of Spain begins to
retaliate the injuries and practices of this queen
(Elizabeth); against him not only for the good of this
island, but principally for the maintenance of the greatness
and reputation of Christendom. You cannot
conceive how the exploit of Leicester and Drake has
raised the hearts of the enemies of the king, and how
his long patience with this queen has tried the confidence
the Catholics have always had in him. As to myself, I
frankly confess I was very much discouraged to enter
into new proposals, seeing how little effect those of the
past have had. I shut my ears to the different overtures
and propositions that have been made to me for the last
six months by Catholics, not being able to give them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
any answer. Now, having heard of the good intentions
of the king, I have written very fully to some Catholics,
with my opinion on each point, that they may resolve
together on the execution of these. In order to gain
time I have asked them to send you, with all diligence,
one of themselves sufficiently instructed to treat with
you concerning the general offer which has been made
to you. On every point they will show you and the
king that upon their faith they have given me assurance
that, faithfully and sincerely, they will accomplish at the
hazard of their lives what they promise by their deputy.
You will credit them as if I myself had sent them. He
will inform you of the means of my escape from here,
which I undertake to effect provided that I can be
assured of sufficient strength to receive and preserve me
while waiting on the assembling of troops. Thank God,
my health at present is better than it has been for three
months. I thank you very fully for your good offers
on the part of the king, your master, for the 12,000
crowns he is pleased to bestow for my deliverance; in
which they will be employed and in nothing else, for it
is to my great regret that the other 12,000 have been of
so little profit to Scotland. I have notice from London
which tells me ... but without urgent necessity
I shall be very unwilling to be importuned for
these things, which I resist owing to the tax required for
this sum. You will help me if you please to testify to
the king the obligation which I have to him and how
willingly I should repay it if ever I have the means;
and to you in particular I hope not to remain ungrateful.
I have given charge to my ambassador to receive
what you will deliver to him, and to send it to me with
all diligence by the secret means that I have made
known to him.”</p>

<p>“<i>P.S.</i>—As I was sending you enclosed, yours of 5th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
July reached me. Thank God, this way of communication
is so well established that from henceforth you can
write to me when you please. May God give help to
the king my good brother, preserve his children, and
give him all the honour, contentment, and prosperity
that his piety and care for the good of Christianity
merit; in respect of which he will have my daily prayers,
since I cannot serve him otherwise. I thank you for
your diligence in having imparted to him what I
committed to you in my letter of May as much for
what concerns myself as for those poor English gentlemen
whom I cannot abstain from recommending to you,
especially the liberty of Morgan, and some pension,
if by any means you can help him. I have already
answered you about the money that you obtained for
me, and I shall put myself in communication with my
ambassador concerning what more has to come.”</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="smcap">Queen Mary's Will</span></p>

<p>The night before her death Queen Mary was composed
enough, and had the wonderful presence of mind
to write her will in the following businesslike terms:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I,
Mary, by the grace of God, Queen of Scotland and
Dowager of France, being on the point of death and not
having any means of making my will, have myself committed
these articles in writing, and I will and desire
that they have the same force as if they were made in
due form:—</p>

<p>In the first place, I declare that I die in the Catholic
Apostolic and Romish faith. First, I desire that a
complete service be performed for my soul in the
Church of St. Denis in France, and another in St.
Peter's at Rheims, where all my servants are to attend
in such manner as they may be ordered to do by those
to whom I have given directions and who are named
therein. Further, that an annual obit be founded for
prayers for my soul in perpetuity in such place and
after such manner as shall be deemed most convenient.
To furnish funds for this I will that my houses at
Fontainebleau be sold, hoping that the King will
render me assistance, as I have requested him to do in
my memorandum. I will that my estate of Trespagny
be kept by my cousin de Guise for one of his daughters,
if she should come to be married. In these quarters I
relinquish half of the arrears due to me, or a part, on
condition that the others be paid, in order to be expended
by my executors in perpetual alms. To carry
this into effect the better, the documents shall be looked
out and delivered according to the assignment for
accomplishing this. I will also that the money which may
arise from my lawsuit with Secondat, be distributed as
follows:—First, in the discharge of my debts and orders
hereafter mentioned and which are not yet paid: in the
first place, the 2000 crowns to Curle, which I desire to
be paid without any hesitation, they being a marriage
portion, upon which neither Nau nor any other person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
has any claim, whatever obligation he may hold, inasmuch
as it is only fictitious, and the money is mine, and
not borrowed, which since I did but show him, and
afterwards withdrew it; and it was taken from me with
the rest at Chartley; the which I give him, provided
he can recover it agreeably to my promise in payment
of the four thousand francs as promised at my death,
one thousand as a marriage portion for an own sister,
and he having asked me for the rest for his expenses
in prison. As to the payment of a similar sum to Nau
it is not obligatory, and therefore it has always been my
intention that it should be paid last, and then only in
case he should make it appear that he has not acted
contrary to the conditions upon which I gave it him,
and to which my servants were witnesses. As regards the
1200 crowns which he has placed to my account as
having been borrowed by him for my use—600 of
Beauregard, 300 from Jervis, and the remainder from
I know not whom, he must repay them out of his own
money, and I must be quit and my order annulled, as
I have not received any part of it, consequently it
must be still in his possession, unless he has paid it
away. Be this as it may, it is necessary that this sum
should revert to me, I having received nothing; and in
case it has not been paid away, I must have recourse to
his property. I further direct that Pasquier shall account
for the moneys that he has expended and received by
order of Nau, from the hands of the servants of Mons.
de Chateauneuf, the French Ambassador. Further, I
will that my accounts be audited and my treasure paid.
Further, that the wages and sums due to my household,
as well for the last as for the present year, be paid them
before all other things, both wages and pensions, excepting
the pensions of Nau and Curle, until it be
ascertained what there is remaining, or whether they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
have merited any pensioning from me, unless the wife
of Curle be in necessity or be ill-treated on my account:
the wages of Nau after the same manner. I will that
the 2400 francs which I have given to Jane Kennedy
(afterwards married to Sir Andrew Melville; and was
drowned by the upsetting of a boat, the year of the
marriage of James <span class="smcap">VI.</span>) be paid to her in money, as it
was stated in my first deed of gift, which done, the
pension of Willie Douglas shall revert to me, which I
give to Fontenay (Nau's brother) for services and expenses
for which he has had no compensation. I will
that the 4000 francs of that banker's be applied for and
repaid: I have forgotten his name, but the Bishop of
Glasgow will readily recollect it; and if the first order
be not honoured, I desire that another may be given in
the first money from Secondat.</p>

<p>The 10,000 francs which the ambassador has received
for me, I will that they be distributed among
my servants who are now going away, viz.—First,
2000 francs to my physician; 2000 francs to Elizabeth
Curle; 2000 to Sebastian Page; 2000 to Mary Page,
my goddaughter; 1000 to Beauregard; 1000 to
Gourgon; 1000 to Jervis. Further, that out of the
rest of my revenue, with the remainder of Secondats
and all other casualties, I will that 5000 francs be given
to the Foundling Hospital at Rheims; to my scholars,
2000 francs. To four mendicants such sum as my
executors may think fit, according to the means in
their hands; 500 francs to the hospitals; to Martin
<i>escuyer de cuisine</i>, 1000 francs; 1000 francs to Annibal,
whom I recommend to my cousin de Guise, his godfather,
to place in some situation for his life, in his
service. I leave 500 francs to Nicholas, and 500 for
his daughters when they marry. I leave 500 francs to
Robert Hamilton, and beg my son to take him and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Monsieur de Glasgow, or the Bishop of Ross. I leave to
Didier his registership, subject to the approbation of the
King. I give 5000 francs to Jean Lauder, and beg my
cousin of Guise, or of Mayne, to take him into their
service, and Messieurs de Glasgow and de Ross to see
him provided for. I will that his father be paid his
wages, and leave him 500 francs; 1000 francs to be
paid to Gourgon for money and other things with
which he supplied me in my necessity. I will that if
Bourgoyne should perform the journey agreeably to
the vow which he made for me to St. Nicholas, that
1500 francs be paid to him for this purpose. I leave,
according to my slender means, 6000 francs to the
Bishop of Glasgow, and 3000 to the Bishop of Ross.
And I leave the gift of casualties and reserved
seigneurial rights to my godson the son of Monsieur
de Ruissieu. I give 300 francs to Laurenz, and 300
to Suzanne; and I leave 10,000 francs among the four
persons who have been my sureties and to Varmy
the solicitor. I will that the money arising from the
furniture which I have ordered to be sold in London
shall go to defray the travelling expenses of my
servants to France. My coach I leave to carry my
ladies, and the horses, which they can sell or do what
they like with. There remain about 300 crowns due to
Bourgoyne for the wages of past years, which I desire
may be paid him. I leave 2000 francs to Sir Andrew
Melville, my steward. I appoint my cousin, the Duke
of Guise, principal executor of my will; after him, the
Archbishop of Glasgow, the Bishop of Ross, and
Monsieur de Ruissieu, my chancellor. I desire that Le
Prean may without obstacle hold his two prebends. I
recommend Mary Page, my goddaughter, to my cousin
Madame de Guise, and beg her to take her into her
service, and my aunt de Saint Pierre to get Mowbray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>

honour of God.</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="smcap">Letter of Pope Pius V. to Mary
Queen of Scots</span></p>

<p>The custodier of the following important letter has
authorised its inclusion in this volume:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Most dear Daughter in Christ</span>,—Health and
Apostolic Blessing.</p>

<p>“Having read your Majesty's letter of October 15th
wherein you have fully acquainted Us of your state and
calamity, and being moved thereat in spirit not otherwise
than We ought, We have grieved bitterly over your
misfortunes and woes; but having learnt that your
Majesty has fallen into these mishaps in the defence of
Catholic Faith, this comfort has somewhat eased our
sorrow, so that We can neither call nor deem you
unhappy whom our Saviour calls 'blessed.' For how
can you be unhappy, having borne so many persecutions
for justice sake? You, who for the maintaining of
Almighty God's true worship, have not hesitated to
undergo such toils, and to encounter so many dangers:
you, in fine, who out of your rare zeal for the Catholic
Faith, have feared neither bands nor prisons, a fugitive
from your own kingdom: all of which things, although
to our human spirit seemingly hard and painful and
grievous to be endured, can nevertheless be sweetened
by the love of the divine goodness that is sweeter than
all things.</p>

<p>“Dearest Daughter, although grief for all that you
have lost, and care for your kingdom, may vex your
Majesty, still, as neither honour, nor kingdoms, nor
fleeting riches are to be sought after since we must leave
them behind us: if we seek after good things, let us
covet such as we may possess everlastingly: while if
we fear evil things, let us rather dread those evils which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
are borne by the reprobate without end of their woes.
Therefore we ought neither to be wearied out with evil,
nor despair of what is good, for God Who rescued David
from out the hand of Saul, and Who brought the
Apostle Paul from out the lion's mouth, can likewise
free you from many mishaps, and restore you to your
own kingdom.</p>

<p>“That this may come to pass, We on our part are
ready to aid you with all the helps that lie in our power,
as We have hitherto done. For this end We shall treat
in our own name with each of the Kings whom you
mention, and strongly commend to them your safety
and your kingdom's welfare, as We ought to, being ready
at all times to pay you all such good offices of our
fatherly goodwill as are deserved by your brave and
unconquered spirit, and most manifest care of the
Catholic Faith. We shall furthermore, in the lowliness
of our heart, beseech Almighty God in our prayers to
help you, now that you are labouring under so many
misfortunes, that He may vouchsafe mercifully to give
you fortitude and perseverance in adversity.</p>

<p>“Given at Saint Peter's, Rome, under Fisherman's
ring, January 9th, 1570, in the fourth year of our
pontificate.”</p>

  Before James <span class="smcap">I.</span> had ascended the English throne Pope
  Clément <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> caused it to be intimated to him
  that he prayed for
  him as the son of a virtuous mother; that he desired for him all
  kinds of prosperity, temporal and spiritual, and trusted yet to see
  him a Catholic (Ranke's <i>History of the Popes</i>, vol. ii. pp. 222). </div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
